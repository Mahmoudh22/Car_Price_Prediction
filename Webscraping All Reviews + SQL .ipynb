Every complaint I had on the 2010 is not on the 2012. The 3.6 in the 12 is so much better matched to the Journey then the 3.5 ever was.

TLDR, very little other cars give you this much fun without sacrificing functionality, reliability, mileage, or comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoesn\\'t get terrible mileage as long as you don\\'t drive it like a maniac. Put\\'s mustangs and some chargers/challengers to shame. Has a lot of grip, but steering is numb and very light. Has a bit of rev hang. Leather seats are very comfortable, but the suspension is a bit bumpy at times (its not a german luxury car so its not a big deal). Shifter feels a wee bit numb, but cause it has rubber bushings. Manual transmission has very aggressive gearing, 1st doesn\\'t need any throttle at all to get going and can at time start in 2nd, 80mph @ 3000rpm in 6th. E-Brake handle feels super cheap, but it is a honda so o big deal. Doors are nice and long, giving great visibility. Back end looks super sexy. V6 sounds like pure sex, especially at 4900rpm and up (VTEC range), redlines about 7000rpm, has lots of torque so you can pass in 6th on the highway very easily. MPG is listed at 18/28 but you can realistically get a bit more than 30 on the highway if you use cruise control or don\\'t drive too fast (65-75). Back seats fit up to 3 average sized adults for trips not too long, great rearseat room for a coupe. Auto-dimming rearview mirror is a blessing, and blindspot camera (if yours has it) is very useful. Trunk is pretty spacious, with back seats down it can easily fit skis or snowboards and other long but not too wide cargo cause it has a chokepoint between the trunk and the seats which limits width. Handling is great, but you don\\'t get any feedback from the steering wheel and steering is super light (electric pwsteering). Body doesn\\'t roll too much in corners. in my opinion, VERY UNDERBRAKED. Brakes are not nearly big enough for the power this car has. Good for normal use but driving at a track or in Mexico at 100mph+ the brakes fade extremely quickly and lose stopping power, then begin to warp a bit (goes a way after a while but sucks in the moment) I had a couple \"Oh xxxx\" moments underestimating the brakes due to them being hot. User beware. Get some LED headlights if it doesn\\'t come with any, the halogen bulbs are pretty weak. FCW (front collision warning) is very annoying and too sensitive at the lowest setting so turn that off. ECO mode is absolutely a must, it does NOT limit power it just makes the already sensitive throttle more linear and natural feeling, saving vital MPG during normal driving. Pedals are kind of small so harder to heel-toe in normal or more narrow shoes. You will have to replace tires often cause burnouts are so easy and fun even possible up to 3rd (joking obviously). \\r\\n\\r\\nIF skeptical, BUY ONE! just make sure it was taken care of, but you will have tons of fun while still being able to daily it every day for a trillion miles cause the Honda J35 runs for centuries (the ones without cylinder deactivation). DONT LET FWD DEALBREAK YOU! it still drives and handles amazingly. \\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion: amazing daily for enthusiasts looking for a good combo of fun, comfort, reliability.', 'May 16, 2021\\nBy Allll from Denver, co\\nOwns this car', 'Nice care  I love to drive no probleme whith this car  easy to fix always Iowan Honda car and affordable car to buy  I lo', 'May  6, 2021\\nBy Johnsongirl on deck from Rocky mount nc\\nOwns this car', \"I enjoy and love my Honda but need to fix the problem I've been having with it for a while now in which that's why I brought it to the dealership this week and last week which cost me ruffly $800.00 and the issue is still unresolved so pissed.\", 'April  2, 2023\\nBy Pleased customer from Rogers, AR\\nOwns this car', 'I have owned my CRV since 2008.

I had moved on to much higher end vehicles from Toyota and even had a Volvo. Just this past year everything changed and I essentially had to start over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A dealer that specialized helping people in my situation put me in a 2012 Journey. I'm very happy with it! Every complaint I had on the 2010 is not on the 2012. The 3.6 in the 12 is so much better matched to the Journey then the 3.5 ever was. It has way more power and gets about 25 mpg or 5 more then the 2010.\r\n",

      "Great daily. TLDR, very little other cars give you this much fun without sacrificing functionality, reliability, mileage, or comfort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Doesn't get terrible mileage as long as you don't drive it like a maniac. Put's mustangs and some chargers/challengers to shame. Has a lot of grip, but steering is numb and very light. Has a bit of rev hang. Leather seats are very comfortable, but the suspension is a bit bumpy at times (its not a german luxury car so its not a big deal). Shifter feels a wee bit numb, but cause it has rubber bushings. Manual transmission has very aggressive gearing, 1st doesn't need any throttle at all to get going and can at time start in 2nd, 80mph @ 3000rpm in 6th. E-Brake handle feels super cheap, but it is a honda so o big deal. Doors are nice and long, giving great visibility. Back end looks super sexy. V6 sounds like pure sex, especially at 4900rpm and up (VTEC range), redlines about 7000rpm, has lots of torque so you can pass in 6th on the highway very easily. MPG is listed at 18/28 but you can realistically get a bit more than 30 on the highway if you use cruise control or don't drive too fast (65-75). Back seats fit up to 3 average sized adults for trips not too long, great rearseat room for a coupe. Auto-dimming rearview mirror is a blessing, and blindspot camera (if yours has it) is very useful. Trunk is pretty spacious, with back seats down it can easily fit skis or snowboards and other long but not too wide cargo cause it has a chokepoint between the trunk and the seats which limits width. Handling is great, but you don't get any feedback from the steering wheel and steering is super light (electric pwsteering). Body doesn't roll too much in corners. in my opinion, VERY UNDERBRAKED. Brakes are not nearly big enough for the power this car has. Good for normal use but driving at a track or in Mexico at 100mph+ the brakes fade extremely quickly and lose stopping power, then begin to warp a bit (goes a way after a while but sucks in the moment) I had a couple \"Oh xxxx\" moments underestimating the brakes due to them being hot. User beware. Get some LED headlights if it doesn't come with any, the halogen bulbs are pretty weak. FCW (front collision warning) is very annoying and too sensitive at the lowest setting so turn that off. ECO mode is absolutely a must, it does NOT limit power it just makes the already sensitive throttle more linear and natural feeling, saving vital MPG during normal driving. Pedals are kind of small so harder to heel-toe in normal or more narrow shoes. You will have to replace tires often cause burnouts are so easy and fun even possible up to 3rd (joking obviously). \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "IF skeptical, BUY ONE! just make sure it was taken care of, but you will have tons of fun while still being able to daily it every day for a trillion miles cause the Honda J35 runs for centuries (the ones without cylinder deactivation). DONT LET FWD DEALBREAK YOU! it still drives and handles amazingly. \r\n",

After four years and only 50,000 miles, the problems started. At around 51,300 miles, the transmission fell apart. On the freeway, no less. We had the car fixed and the same thing happened the next year. This time, in our driveway. After getting it fixed again, my father used it for another three years before the parking brake broke. The cable literally SNAPPED. We got it fixed and then my dad gave the car to me. I would drive it to my work and back. About two years and 30,000 more miles later, a check engine light appeared. It was because there was a problem with the gas cap not being tight enough. We couldn’t fix this problem, so we ignored it. Then, we finally got rid of it a year after when the transmission died AGAIN! We got the car fixed and traded it in for a Ford Fusion. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM HONDAS!! THEY ARE UNRELIABLE!!\n",

      "  - I purchased this car new but kept it only 2 years as I needed more space for my growing kids, their friends, and their activities. Mine was a sport model with black and white interior. Despite a rather average gas mileage for the size of the car, everything else was solid and the car was pretty spacious inside. The sport tuned suspension made it more fun to drive than the average Jetta. The only regret that I had is that this year model didn't come with a sunroof, even as an option. Other than that, it's a great car for a small family and the interior is resistant to active children :)\n",

It really is everything I could possibly ask from an under $10K car and then some.\r\n",

Will be replacing the timing belt/water pump soon, only because I have no idea on when they were last replaced.\r\n",

      "  - I thought it would be a good value when i bought it used with 138k miles.  I have a 2012 Mazda 3 sedan, 5spd manual transmission.  The reverse gear has always been tempermental, sometimes having to shift into gear twice for it to go in reverse.  Yesterday I tried to go in reverse, it has suddenly disappeared, transmission will not shift into gear. Everything ive read online in forums about this issue has been the same experience that Ive had, and there is no recall or fix from the factory to solve the problem. It seems Mazda is aware of the issue, and tries to give brief \"work around\" issues to make it go in reverse.........this is from the maker of the car lol. xxx Mazda.  This has clearly been an issue on this model and they never resolved it.  I checked all fluids, all linkage,etc etc.  Now i have a 2000lb Mazda paperweight in my driveway, a hotel for stray cats and possum, As i am on a limited budget, i dont have the money to take it around from garage to garage to find out the problem.  I WOULD GIVE THIS CAR ZERO STARS IF I COULD. DO NOT BUY A MAZDA 3 FROM THE 2011 GENERATION,  PAY A LITTLE MORE AND BUY A HONDA OR TOYOTA.  I'D EVEN SETTLE FOR A KIA AT THIS POINT.  THANKS FOR THE WORTHLESS PIECE OF JUNK MAZDA.   BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",

       "   'A perspective from a car guy who has owned many sports cars: the ATS is a really solid sports sedan, but sales indicated not many folks wanted this great sports sedan. Why? It’s goodness has a few flies in the ointment: here are some quirks to this good car that frustrate and bother. \\r\\nHandling is great, but I question the run-flat tire design decision. Run-flats are harsh and noisy, but the suspension is tuned to compensate (except for the noise).  There are no jack points or jack, so we are kinda stuck with the expense and noise. \\r\\nThe 2.0 liter dual-scroll turbo is really fun. The light-weight body allows the engine to move the car quickly and nimbly. The engine does have draw-backs. Blow-by can carbon up the valves, and since the engine is direct injection, the valves are not cleaned by the atomized intake gas. Carefully scheduled oil changes are crucial for engine longevity. \\r\\nAnd then there is the CUE system. The knob-less infotainment system is better than you would expect (one gets used to it in surprising ways), but the touch-screen overlay dies. It has a gel layer between two screens that dries out and renders the touch screen useless. The part to repair it is cheap, but the center console must be completely disassembled to get to the screen. Very very poor engineering because cars sit in the sun and the the gel will delaminate. (Replacement screens without the gel layer are available.) Folks are frustrated: you didn’t hear it from me, but there is a class action suit regarding this screen and Cadillac’s blindness to addressing it’s flaws. \\r\\nI’m 6-0 and hit my head on the door edge every time I get in and out. You’d expect that of a goofy Italian car, but not of a Cadillac. Big deal?  No, just reality. \\r\\nSo, with no spare it has a huge trunk, right?  Nope. The entire space under the trunk floor from axle to bumper is filled with a huge…..muffler. This is just plain bizarre. Biggest muffler/resonator I’ve ever seen. Exhaust note is underwhelming. \\r\\nWith these little niggling bothers, the car remains one of my favorite sports sedans. It hustles but with composure and control. It is comfy on long drives, but instantly awakens for a mountain drive or twisty. The sales record indicates my frustrations are common. But drive it. I think you will fall in love with her and her “beauty-marks.”']},\n",

Now the CONS- cheap interior plastic design compared to other competitors trucks, can run regular gas but its recommended to use mid grade or premium for all around fuel efficiency and engine life, do not use engine fuel/ octane boosters! all aluminum engine is good but bad if it runs to hot for to long as your heads will warp. rough ride compared to other trucks. other than that this truck is as solid as they come.

       "   'Now I am going to start this out by saying I am not a Ford guy. My family always used Honda because of there unmatched reliability, so I had grown fond of Honda. But I got my first sport trac when I was 16, and anybody who was a teenager and had a vehicle would know you would have some fun with it. When I tell you I stress tested the Sport Trac, I really did. Everything from offroading, had pulled upto 3,000 lbs worth of scrap metal a few times(dont do that tho, was very dangerous, bent bumper ball), and general use and abuse of the vehicle. And at no point did I ever have a real complaint. Its engine had never given me a single issue, and I got it already with about 178k miles. Biggest issue with it was rust, but the engine is a BEAST. Its poor gas mileage makes up for the fact that its engine, in my opinion, is one of THEE best Ford had made in awhile. It was designed in like the 60s and it showed. The truck overall is really comfortable to drive in. Its GREAT in bad weather if you have 4WD or weight in the bed, legit have pulled out Jeeps and other supposed \"Off-Roading\" Vehicles when mud or snow hindered them, it is honestly a vehicle I\\'d feel safe driving through a Hurricane with. Its reliability is truly unmatched. I have heard other say its ok, and it may just be a flip of a coin or that half were made in one factory and the other in another factory, but I am on my second Sport Trac, only because my previous one had too much rust to pass. The only reason I hold its reliability to such high regard is because I beat the snot out of my little sport trac and it always got back up without an issue. From scrapping metal with it to just being a teenager and taking it offroading where it certainly shouldnt be able to go. I could go on about how much I love this truck, I may be biased due to it being my first car, but I wouldn\\'t hold it in such high regard if it didnt get me through every snowstorm, mud ditch, big stream, and hot summer day hauling metal, all without any issue or hesitation. I couldn\\'t recommend any other first car than the sport trac. Because it will keep you or your kid safe, both when they are using it normally, as well as when they be teenagers with it. My only issue with it was the fact it had a bumper ball, and that its bed was a bit short for hauling metal. But it makes you a master packer with ratchet straps. 10/10, would recommend it, especially as a first car.',\n",

Over the next four years I would replace the tires and have the suspension done. All of these things are consumable parts and replacing them after 100,000 is not out of the norm.  \\nOther than that, I replaced the speakers because the factory ones were not too great.   \\nWhat really got me was, no oddities.

I have owned cars where random hoses, engine parts, or transmission parts deteriorated and cost me a random $1000 to fix. Not this one.

It is deep, but the opening is not very accommodating. I bought a couple of outdoor chairs at Target (non folding) and could not get them in the trunk.

I have previously owned three German Cars; a 1999 Mercedes SL500 Roadster, a 2005 BMW 645i Convertible, and a 2013 BMW 328 M-Sport. The Benz and the BMWs were always in the dealer for something wrong. Though the SL500 was the most reliable of the three previous cars with less technology to go wrong, those two makes in general are over-engineered cars and is why there is always a dozen cars waiting to get serviced when you arrive at the dealership service dept. Porsche however, I've never seen more than a customer or two in front of me or in the waiting area. Porsche Dealers have Porsche service loaners available too…Mecans and Cayenne Hybrids!  Porsche manufacturer even worked with me for a blistering dash leather problem in the Cayenne (with full leather package) when it was out of warranty and offered it to me at half the cost to replace this $4500 parts and labor job. Was acceptable for a four-year-old car to be rejuvenated with a new dash! During this last year, in the cars eighth year since new, I still get notices from Porsche manufacture of warranty extensions on parts like the Speed Sensor and the Transfer Case, none of which went out on mine yet, but it’s nice to see they really want to make sure you have a reliable car and if there is an issue, Porsche will quickly take care of it. It still drives like new 8 years later. A slight door rattle in the driver and passenger front interior door by the arm rest got slightly noticeable at times after 60k miles, but that was a $65, 1hr labor, fix at the dealer with some padding near the door trim accent/ambient lighting panel on the doors arm rests. At 80k miles, it started again, so it could use another padding adjustment. The leather is very durable and still holds up at about 90% like new with very little wrinkling and side wear from getting in and out of the car. The back seats still look like new as they were hardly used. My carpets are a light blue, but a good shampoo every six months keeps the light color clean and looking about 70 percent from new, not bad for an eight-year-old car when other American cars that old can see holes in the leather and carpeted areas by then. I fully enjoy sport mode, and mostly keep it on to have that quick launch when needed to change a lane or get on a freeway, etc. It tends to lag and a launch without sport mode on which can sometimes make you lose the opportunity to get in that lane or whatever you needed that extra second of instant launch for. The 21” tires do burn through rubber quickly, cost about $225 each to replace, and I recommend rotating them regularly every 4k-5k miles, but you are rewarded with sports sedan like handling in return. The full leather package with brushed metal accents truly make this interior super premium. Base models without the leather really have a lesser than premium feel, so I recommend full leather if you can garage the car and can keep it parked out of the blistering Los Angeles sun for periods of time. Other than that, the 2012 Porsche Cayenne S is a car that if treated right with proper care and maintenance, should last 200k-300k miles.\",\n",

       "   'In 2013, I bought a new Altima (4 cylinder, SV trim) at Concordville Nissan. Aside from the usurious interest they charged me for the financing, everything seemed okay with the car. Then about five or six years ago, the secondary latch for my hood malfunctioned and my hood flew open on the highway, completely blocking the view out the windshield and almost causing me to crash. It also damaged both front quarter panels. Later, there was a recall notice about this, but it was too late for me. \\r\\n\\r\\nAbout two years ago, the right rear control arm completely broke away from the frame WHILE I WAS IN MY DRIVEWAY causing the right rear wheel to collapse in on itself. It was a good thing it happened where it did because the day before, I had been on Route 78 near Allentown driving next to dozens of semis in concrete cattle chutes. I could have been killed if it had snapped off then. Nissan did pay to fix this, but there should have been some sort of additional compensation for selling me a car that almost killed me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the \"CVT\" transmission in the Altima totally failed a month ago, the repair cost estimate for which exceeded $5,000. With just 110,000 miles on the odometer after ten years, this car should have been worth anywhere from $8,000 to $12,000. Instead, the CVT transmission failure essentially turned the car into scrap metal. I asked if Concordville Nissan would buy the car back from me and they  initially offered me a measly $500 even though they knew that the CVT transmissions on these cars were failing very prematurely. After I posted an initial version of this review, Concordville Nissan reached out to me and agreed to pay $1,500. Not a bad deal for them considering that Nissan raked in $6,000 in interest on top of the purchase price. They can now repair the car at their hourly rate costs and then sell it in a hot used car market with low inventory. \\r\\n\\r\\nI wish in retrospect I had bought a Honda, Toyota, Mazda, etc. Those manufacturers know how to take care of their customers. For example, I had a 1999 Toyota Tacoma which had issues with excessive underbody corrosion. Instead of leaving their customers high and dry like Nissan has done to me here, Toyota recalled the truck at 1.5 times the blue book value in 2008.That worked out to be $15,000 for a nine year old pickup. That was 15 years ago, too, when the dollar was worth a lot more than it is now. Concordville Nissan, on the other hand, gave me just $1,500. They and/or Nissan corporate, knowing that CVT transmissions were failing well before their time, should have bought back my car years ago like Toyota did. Or they could have offered me a new car at their cost with no interest financing. That’s how Toyota would have handled it.',\n",

First, the engine ate a rod bearing at 40k miles requiring the entire engine to be replaced which took over a month in the shop.  Then repeated exhaust leaks had to be chased down.  Second, the DEF system throws error codes at least once a month stating it will make the vehicle inoperable in 200 miles unless serviced.  Third, the repeated recall after recall relating to several exhaust issues.  Fourth, the Summit version, which I bought, has leather on the dash so poorly glued that the whole thing has started delaminating.  Yet for that there's no recall or TSB for this obvious flaw and Jeep refused to fix it.  Fifth, the diesel oil, filter and DEF refill every 10k costs over $300 a pop. Sixth, the fuel filters, there are 2, require replacing every 15k miles at a cost of around $170 each.  Seventh, the wheel arch covers have come unglued and Jeep refuses to fix that either saying it's a wear item and body issue that an independent body shop must fix.   Eighth, the glow plugs are known to go bad and be hard to remove without snapping them which will require the entire head to need replacing at a cost of around $4,000.

I have had to change the valve cover gasket the PCV system and convertible seals as well as the brake dust shields and E-brake and the trunk floods when parked if the trunk is not on flat ground. However, minus those small issues here and there it’s great the Audio system is great can even overpower the road noise that comes with driving a convertible and you can hear it with the top down as well. The interior is a mixed bag this is before the entire BMW brand shifted towards more luxury the real wood trim is nice and 5 Series peak early 2000s business radio feel good, and the seats are decent even accommodating for tall people also for a convertible since this car is based on a E46 3 series the trunk is decent for a convertible. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhere the cons start is here the rest of the interior feels super cheap it’s a parts bin special the climate controls and vents are 2000s Hyundai levels cheap they creek and rattle same with the rest of the nonspecific trim pieces from 1 series or something else the steering wheels is the best example where it was clearly just pulled from some other car and the early 2000s button are plastic sticky mess typical with BMW’s from this era. Where some is forgiven is the engine the motor is strong little torquey motor with 5 gears 4 of witch are super short it never feels low on power and if you need to do highway speeds it’s good at that since 5th is made for going at highway speeds and being able to pass in 5th gear at 25% throttle while listening to classical music overpowering the interior rattling. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn a B-road the inline 6 between 1 to third gear is fun with plenty of power the motor makes noise you can make it scream but it is not annoying to drive and can be quiet when wanted in 4th. it’s good at what the primary customer will do with it cruise Newport Rhode Island with the top down around town or by the coast like a budget 911 cabriolet. This car is more livable than a NB Miata or SW-30 MR2 but not as fun on a backroad and this cars steering is dead since first gen electronic power steering but a good overall compromise car that’s okay or decent at everything.

       "   'Great overall little commuter hatchback. \\r\\nWe got ours a few years old with low mileage due to the options we wanted. The other reviews are kind of silly on here, complaining about a car due to lack of options selected by the buyer. Yes it wont have heated seats if you dont get the heated seat models lol. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur model is the EX, it has a sunroof, blind mirror indicator, heated seats, and a manual 6 speed transmission. Basically all features any high end model could use, I dont like leather seats due to the degradation long term. Just make sure you avoid the CVT transmission. Our area would not offer manual 6 speed on the high end trim so we had to travel out of state to get ours. \\r\\n\\r\\nFew mods added to the car to make it even better: \\r\\n- bi-led projector retrofit on headlights\\r\\n- led bulbs all around, plates, interior. \\r\\n- auto dim rear view mirror (easy wire in) \\r\\n- front facing dash cam \\r\\n- sirius satellite radio \\r\\n- winter aluminum rims (instead of steelies), summer has factory 17\" aluminum black/silver combo\\r\\n- towing hitch (bike carrier) -- vehicle rated at 2000 lbs\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall its been very reliable, super practical with the folding seats. It gets excellent fuel efficiency and fits everywhere. Power wise, its very snappy given with a manual transmission you can control it a lot better than the sloppy CVT. The manual does 0-60mph in 8 seconds or less, which is very fast for a little car. Its not a tesla or a GTR with 130hp but its plenty for its 36-40 mpg. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne issue ours had was the starter went out really early, but it was an easy change out, its a known issue. The seats are not very comfortable for long trips but thats because they are so small and its a commuter car.\\r\\nThe cam gear also can get noisy on these at start up, so they will rattle but has no impact to performance. \\r\\nWe have just over 100k miles on ours and its a very strong little car, will be getting another one of the final production year as this one gets higher in mileage. Again get the manual 6, you will not regret it, honda manual cars are semi automatic, the clutch is like a feather vs. a subaru for example. Totally worth it.',\n",

Having a second Cam, and weighing less than the previous generation is a boon to it’s performance. While the Car is certainly comfortable, it’s lacking heated seats is a tad unfortunate. The handling is great with maybe a lighter steering feel, but on wider tires that goes away. The Fit feels equally at home carving mountain passes as it does on city streets. As for the styling, there are fake vents on the rear of the car that are somewhat distracting to me, but those have been slimmed down with models more recent than the 2015 I bought. The magic seats are an awesome space saving solution and the rear seats have much more space than the car is given credit for.

I have read a lot of reviews saying the same thing. Some even before 40k miles. Thankfully i had warranty cover it so I'm hoping it doesn't go out again. Supposedly they just reset the motor and it started working again. Other then that I just do regular maintenance on it like shocks, struts, brakes, rotors, and oil changes and that's about it. I got the car 11/2017 with 39k miles. It now has 78k miles. I live in Silicon Valley and have taken the vehicle to Los Angeles twice and drove all around the vicinity and got above 24 miles a gallon. Also i saw reviews that it has a weak transmission. I have mechanics tell me to do transmission exchanges every 30-35k miles depending on how you drive on this specific vehicle because of how vulnerable the tranny is . I didn't do mine until almost 40k miles later after I bought the car so I was above the safe zone. All in all take care of it and it'll take care of you.\"]},\n",

Although it is almost as large outside as the Passat, it offers noticeably less usable cargo volume, albeit still sufficient for most purposes. Sideward and rearward visibility are better than average, but no match for the Passat wagon, which is almost unbeatable in this category. Styling is elegantly clean, simple, and timeless.\\n\\nWe have had no problems yet, and we happily note that the engine has a generous 6 qt. oil capacity, versus the Passat\\'s 3.7 qts., which I expand to 4.25 by using an oversized Mann oil filter.

I specifically asked my Sales Consultant Aaron if this car has any frame or flood damage and he stated NO! My car stopped working due to water in my trunk which damaged the electrical system. The repair bill was $1200 and I only had the car for 6 months. I took it to the body repair shop where they showed me the frame damage and the repair bill is over $4000. I was lied to and its costing me so much money.  I expressed because of my poor vision the features that are important for me to have in my next vehicle. When I purchased the car, the rear view camera feature listed was not even in the car when delivered to my home in Georgia.  I spoke with my Sales Consultant and was told to get a quote and give him a call. I tried calling for over a month. I have not received a call back since.  I’ve reached out to management starting in March about the frame damage  and they always just take my number down and no one has yet to give me a call back.

       "   'In 2013, I bought a new Altima (4 cylinder, SV trim) at Concordville Nissan. Aside from the usurious interest they charged me for the financing, everything seemed okay with the car. Then about five or six years ago, the secondary latch for my hood malfunctioned and my hood flew open on the highway, completely blocking the view out the windshield and almost causing me to crash. It also damaged both front quarter panels. Later, there was a recall notice about this, but it was too late for me. \\r\\n\\r\\nAbout two years ago, the right rear control arm completely broke away from the frame WHILE I WAS IN MY DRIVEWAY causing the right rear wheel to collapse in on itself. It was a good thing it happened where it did because the day before, I had been on Route 78 near Allentown driving next to dozens of semis in concrete cattle chutes. I could have been killed if it had snapped off then. Nissan did pay to fix this, but there should have been some sort of additional compensation for selling me a car that almost killed me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the \"CVT\" transmission in the Altima totally failed a month ago, the repair cost estimate for which exceeded $5,000. With just 110,000 miles on the odometer after ten years, this car should have been worth anywhere from $8,000 to $12,000. Instead, the CVT transmission failure essentially turned the car into scrap metal. I asked if Concordville Nissan would buy the car back from me and they  initially offered me a measly $500 even though they knew that the CVT transmissions on these cars were failing very prematurely. After I posted an initial version of this review, Concordville Nissan reached out to me and agreed to pay $1,500. Not a bad deal for them considering that Nissan raked in $6,000 in interest on top of the purchase price. They can now repair the car at their hourly rate costs and then sell it in a hot used car market with low inventory. \\r\\n\\r\\nI wish in retrospect I had bought a Honda, Toyota, Mazda, etc. Those manufacturers know how to take care of their customers. For example, I had a 1999 Toyota Tacoma which had issues with excessive underbody corrosion. Instead of leaving their customers high and dry like Nissan has done to me here, Toyota recalled the truck at 1.5 times the blue book value in 2008.That worked out to be $15,000 for a nine year old pickup. That was 15 years ago, too, when the dollar was worth a lot more than it is now. Concordville Nissan, on the other hand, gave me just $1,500. They and/or Nissan corporate, knowing that CVT transmissions were failing well before their time, should have bought back my car years ago like Toyota did. Or they could have offered me a new car at their cost with no interest financing. That’s how Toyota would have handled it.',\n",

Third, the repeated recall after recall relating to several exhaust issues.  Fourth, the Summit version, which I bought, has leather on the dash so poorly glued that the whole thing has started delaminating.

Sixth, the fuel filters, there are 2, require replacing every 15k miles at a cost of around $170 each.  Seventh, the wheel arch covers have come unglued and Jeep refuses to fix that either saying it's a wear item and body issue that an independent body shop must fix.

I have had to change the valve cover gasket the PCV system and convertible seals as well as the brake dust shields and E-brake and the trunk floods when parked if the trunk is not on flat ground. However, minus those small issues here and there it’s great the Audio system is great can even overpower the road noise that comes with driving a convertible and you can hear it with the top down as well. The interior is a mixed bag this is before the entire BMW brand shifted towards more luxury the real wood trim is nice and 5 Series peak early 2000s business radio feel good, and the seats are decent even accommodating for tall people also for a convertible since this car is based on a E46 3 series the trunk is decent for a convertible. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhere the cons start is here the rest of the interior feels super cheap it’s a parts bin special the climate controls and vents are 2000s Hyundai levels cheap they creek and rattle same with the rest of the nonspecific trim pieces from 1 series or something else the steering wheels is the best example where it was clearly just pulled from some other car and the early 2000s button are plastic sticky mess typical with BMW’s from this era. Where some is forgiven is the engine the motor is strong little torquey motor with 5 gears 4 of witch are super short it never feels low on power and if you need to do highway speeds it’s good at that since 5th is made for going at highway speeds and being able to pass in 5th gear at 25% throttle while listening to classical music overpowering the interior rattling. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn a B-road the inline 6 between 1 to third gear is fun with plenty of power the motor makes noise you can make it scream but it is not annoying to drive and can be quiet when wanted in 4th. it’s good at what the primary customer will do with it cruise Newport Rhode Island with the top down around town or by the coast like a budget 911 cabriolet. This car is more livable than a NB Miata or SW-30 MR2 but not as fun on a backroad and this cars steering is dead since first gen electronic power steering but a good overall compromise car that’s okay or decent at everything.

The AC compressor has needed two replacements, minor exhaust leak and oil leak that were easily repaired, brake pad replacements etc. but no major issues, transmission is still great. Be sure to use the parking brake every time to prevent transmission damage since these vehicles can sometimes have transmission issues. If you use the parking brake it may help prevent that. LOVE the way it handles, great steering, great visibility, powerful engine. I love this vehicle!',\n",

       "   'The 5th ford SUV my family has owned. Overall have had good experiences. After putting 180,000 miles, on my 1998 explorer. Standard maintenance costs starting to exceed value. \\nSearched 6 months for one with low miles, 80,000, in my price range $5000. Have had constant, costly repairs almost since the beginning. After 3 different attempts to correct misfires, hesitation, stalling & stranding. Problem was intermittent at first. Mechanic couldn\\'t duplicate problem and wasn\\'t putting out any codes. Jumped/charged 3 separate times before finally no start. I\\'ve replaced 2 batteries, brakes, water pump, all 6 coils & plugs. Still problem persists and getting only 4 MPG. Relent & take it to Ford dealership who charged me $150 to diagnose  what AutoZone code reader finally picked up (free of charge) that it needs replacement FRP Sensor.  Code PO193, cost $500. WRONG! After some research on Ford Forums & Car Complaints & NHTSA\\'s websites I found 2 TSB\\'s (technical service bulletins) were issued about spark plugs causing radio frequency interference wreaking havoc on multiple electronic components. Most notably and always eventually frying the PCM (Power Control Module). The computer that stores all problem codes, regulates (then ruining) all electric components of vehicle. Costs nearly $2000 for replacement that only a Ford Dealer can repair. That\\'s if they can locate a refurbished one. They are in very short supply. I wonder why? The cost of 6 new spark plugs, had they issued an actual recall, $15.00. Reason for TSB as opposed to recall. They aren\\'t required to issue a recall unless seen as a safety hazard. I\\'VE READ HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS WHERE IT COMPLETELY STALLED, AT HIGH SPEEDS, LOSING POWER TO STEERING, BRAKES, LIGHTS, ETC. Absolutely a safety issue. \\nDo your homework. I looked up my 2005, 3.0 Ford Escape on Cars.com, Edmunds, and Consumer Reports b4 getting car fax & this was not mentioned anywhere.  I mentioned PCM flashing, reprogramming, replacement was suggested in conjunction with spark plugs & coils replacement ($950), I had done recently. The mechanic treated me like I was stupid. I called another mechanic after getting wrong recommended repair diagnosis from Ford & he laughed saying \"I won\\'t touch those things!\"  You fix it and 3 months later same problem starts all over again!']},\n",

Two days later, I had to go for preparations to bury my son, over 800 miles away. I was very fearful, because I had this JGC that I had never driven before, and I was on this journey alone. I have seen so many cars with temp plates sitting on the side of the road, and was fearful mine could just be another one. Needless to say, the only 2 things I haven\\'t liked about my vehicle transaction, is that there is no owners manual, and evidently the sensor for low fuel doesn\\'t work. I knew about the owners manual before the purchase, but not the low fuel indicator. I will just fill up at 1/4 tank asI always have. LOVE, LOVE this vehicle.....stylish, comfy, and all the perks.

Hits way above its price tag. The seats are very comfortable, plenty of room for taller people in back and front. Gas mileage is great and the Bose radio is very enjoyable to listen too.  Almost everything inside feels good to the touch and is premium. Is it perfect? No. The road noise is loud. Almost too loud. I knew that going into it but didn’t think it would be an issue but its annoying (and this is coming from a 2003 camry). The ride is firm and sporty so don’t expect a lounge chair, the upside to that is excellent handling. Storage inside is minimal and beside the road noise is my only big complaint.  But at least the trunk is generous and their is room where it counts. This car gets looks everywhere I go and is fun to drive. No it’s not fast but it is adequate.  So in summary the three biggest highlights are looks, mpg and premium feel. If those are not high priorities look elsewhere.  It was a good deal and fits my needs for now. Would I buy again? Probably not. The latest generation camry isn’t far off the marks in the looks department and I can only speculate offers more supple ride and far less road noise. But used ones still cost more then the mazda 6 I bought as well. Im hoping the mazda is as reliable as it is nice to look at and that will help.']},\n",

There was a Corolla on the lot, which was way older, had a higher mileage, and was $500 more. I said no way, stick it Toyota. I’m going American, and I am so glad I made that choice. My focus didn’t disappoint me at all, with a well designed well thought out interior design, and sporty exterior styling. Very comfortable and quiet ride. And impressive gas mileage. 37 MPG on the highway, and around town about 33. Awesome gas mileage, and it only costs me $50 a week for a full tank. Been pretty reliable, did have a few little transmission hiccups. But took it in and were soon fixed under warranty. Other than that, no other reliability problems to report in two years of ownership. Definitely recommend this car.',\n",

       "   'This is a late review but I have owned my 2014 JCW Coupe for six years and about 30,000 miles. I have had zero problems so far. I have tracked it once and one autocross. I have the automatic and it sucks at autocross but is amazing on the track. For non-track people here are the best and weakest points: \\nBEST: Style-I get more comments than any other cars I’ve owned including MB AMG’s and BMW M’s.  Performance: It is a deceptively quick car that is fun in city or open road. Reliability: So far great. I also alternate winter and summer performance tires. Does great all year. Mileage: I can get 38mpg on road middle 20’s in city. Trunk: The frame is a regular Mini minus back seats with a chopped roof. Plenty of luggage room for two person road trip. I used it as a work car for a year putting all my sales demo stuff in the trunk.\\nWEAK: Rear view-Learn how to use your side mirrors properly. Small 2-seaters rarely have great visibility. Suspension-I got regular suspension. If you get sport they are hard as a rock. Alter your suspension and get non run-flat tires if you have sport. \\nI unhesitatingly reccomend the coupe for those who love sporty unoque cars. You will just laugh evey time you drive it. I believe they are a good deal and will appreciate as they only ran three years.',\n",

       "   'Have owned my 2016 Kia Soul EV (Base) for 3 weeks now, and put a couple hundred miles on it.\\n\\nIt is the perfect car for commuting. \\n\\nI have a 16 mile round trip to and from work, and I’ve never had range anxiety or any problems whatsoever with this car. \\n\\nI also own a 2017 Kia Sedona EX minivan, and the infotainment features, climate control and\\nwindow/door buttons and procedures are very similar (mostly identical), and comparable. (Back up camera, heated seats, heated steering wheel, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto).\\n\\nThis is a well equipped car!  \\n\\nWhile I have used the Soul EV primarily for commuting, I have also loaded up the family (wife, 3 kids) and  taken it around town, and it performed admirably. \\n\\nWe fit 3 car seats in the back, and it was obviously a tighter fit than the Sedona, but the kids (5, 3, 1) had no complaints. \\n\\nFor performance, I can’t say it’s very fast. Top speed is 90mph. \\n\\nBut the old girl is QUICK! The 0-60 time isn’t impressive, but 0-30? You’re burning cats off the line! The instant torque you have available with an electric drivetrain is awesome for quick maneuvering in the city and on non interstate highways. Merging into traffic is NO problem. In fact, I feel better merging in with the Soul EV than a normal car.\\n\\nOne thing that is unique about the 2014-2016 Soul EV’s is that you can set the car to charge at home on a timer, and have it charge up to either 80% or 100%. The option to stop at 80% was removed for the 2017 and newer models due to some bizarre EPA rule. Many people want to stop at 80% regularly because it’s better for the long term health of the battery to only charge to 100% when that range is really needed. This makes the 2016 and older somewhat desirable for those who are concerned about battery life. It makes it quite simple to manage the battery in a healthy way. \\n\\nThe 2016 being the newest with that option makes it particularly a good buy when you can find one. \\n\\nOne thing to make clear about the battery life is that these cars all have a 10 year/100,000 mile EV system warranty, including the battery pack. \\n\\nThis warranty transfers to each subsequent owner, and is effective from the day it’s sold to the first customer. \\n\\nWhen the battery reaches a state of health (SOH)  level below 70% of new, Kia will repair or replace it for free, under this warranty, regardless of number of owners, as long as you’re under 10/100k. \\n\\nFor example, my 2016 wasn’t originally sold until Aug 2017. That means I have a full battery warranty till Aug 2027 or 100k miles. I’m at 19738 miles today. \\n\\nI think there are many of these types of situations sitting on lots today. \\n\\nCars with lots of battery life and warranty left. At LOW prices. \\n\\nThe 2014-2018 Souls have depreciated a lot since new, due primarily to one factor: \\n\\nThe 2019-2020 and newer EV’s from Kia/Hyundai, Chevy, and others have more than doubled the range of these older ones. \\n\\nThey are all above 200 and creeping up on 300 miles of electric range. That’s great! \\n\\nBut if you don’t currently have 30-40k to spend on a new one, and don’t have a 70-80+ mile daily commute, then these 100 miler 2014-2018’s are a STEAL right now. \\n\\nThey’re going as low as 10-12k in some cases at the moment, and may go even a bit lower. \\n\\nBut many are low mileage, in excellent shape, have lots of battery life and warranty left. And they’re still well equipped like they are a $35k new vehicle -which they were in 2016. \\n\\nI’ll end by saying, I feel sad for my poor old gas Sedona. I just don’t feel like driving it anymore! We have her for the occasional large load or longer trip... but I have to say: \\n\\nI only go to the gas station for snacks and drinks these days! \\n\\nOwning an EV is WAY more cool and MUCH less weird and stressful than I thought it would be!']},\n",

       "   'I\\'ve never thought of writing a review on anything; yet alone, a used car.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, I bought a 2008 Toyota Yaris 2 months ago. I was in a crucial position. I had to find a good, reliable, used car under $8,000, pay in cash, and it has to last me until I die! ☠️ My car, they stopped making, and sometimes it works, sometimes it don\\'t.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ve got at least 2 lives depending on this car! My mom is almost 87, I\\'m 47, on disability, divorced, and I don\\'t even know if my 2 teenage daughters want a relationship with me after 18. All due to my evil ex and his mommy. Even my cat\\'s life depends on this car.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, I did some research, looked at these reviews, and accidentally found my car whom I named \"Ashley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSome guy sent me 4 cars that matched what I was looking for. My eyeball went to #2. The guy said he can show it to me the next day. I stalled him cuz I was researching. So, a few days later, my mom and I went to test drive it (I already planned to buy this car). After the ride, I actually added a 2 year warranty just for peace of mind. Thank God, this was from a dealer. Good thing too, that darn engine light was increasing my anxiety. So, I took the car to AutoZone. I don\\'t think many people know this, but they can check your engine light, battery, recharge your battery and basically do a diagnostic for FREE! I went back on another day and got the same result which was the EVAP canister.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took it to my dealer and they said this looks brand new! So, I took it back one more time, they gave me a $40,000 rental car, and the next day, my car passed the DEQ test! All they did was brush off the container and drive it around, then FINALLY! No lights come on, and I just feel so blessed right now. The other 3 cars I later found out were stick. I happened to pick the only automatic. The weird thing though is the speedometer, console etc. is in the middle. So, that\\'s something I gotta get used to. The cupholders are on the left and right, but I don\\'t care. Just something to get from point A to B so I don\\'t miss appointments or emergencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ❤️ this car! I got really lucky, and adding that warranty was worth it. Oh, this had 171,000 miles, and it\\'s still going. Use at least 87 octane for gas, do those oil checks, and get the save and drive beacon from State Farm.

The car is fun to drive without a doubt, but as you start climbing the mileage stuff starts really breaking. The only people who work on it are specialty shops or Mini themselves which will cost you a fortune. Over my ownership of 5 years I have gone from 92,000 miles to 136,000 miles. I have replaced the diverter valve twice, a valve cover, a clutch which will cost you almost $3000, tires, oil, and other basic parts. Currently the car needs a new oil filter housing and a water pump around $1500 for parts and labor on those two parts. The 2012 also has this weird break in-between where if your car was manufactured before march of 2012 parts from the older notorious N14 engine were used that were not reliable and often break. Things that would be covered by normal car companies are not covered by mini including a passenger airbag sensor if you are out of 120K miles or 10 year.

The car is super quick on the low end from a dig, but acceleration dies down fast after 60mph or so.  Aftermarket support can fix this, adding 30-50whp for maybe $1500.  I beat a V6 Chrysler 300 all the way through the 1/4 mile until the very end, beat an ecoboost Mustang to the 1/8th marker, and this car xxxxs on everything on the 60ft (I know, who cares).\\n\\nNo reliability issues yet.

The T-Tops are great...no leaks even at 20 years old. Two complaints. The dash does have the crack they all have seemed to develop. I guess the huge windshield causes that. Also the GM VAT system is the worst. The constant use of the tilt wheel causes the wires running to the security system to fray shutting the car down cold. Bypassing the system is pretty easy and the problem is fixed for good. Overall I’m really pleased with this purchase and I guess I’ll keep this into my doddering old age for git and shiggles.']},\n",

In addition to reducing the gas bill and my carbon footprint, it required almost no maintenance, had great acceleration, was comfortable, and got me back and forth to work (32 miles roundtrip) twice on a single charge.  The storage space is limited by the battery, but for a simple commuter car that\\'s not much of a concern.  The only reason I recently parted ways with this vehicle was that I moved to the mountains, about 100 miles away from the nearest Ford dealership approved to work on EV\\'s.  I got a \"Stop Safely Now\" message on the car, which would disable the vehicle once it came to a stop.  The local Ford dealer wouldn\\'t even look at the car, so I was forced to tow it to the nearest dealer with an EV technician.  The car didn\\'t have the range to make it there, even if it was safe to drive, and Ford would only reimburse me for the first $100 of a tow. So eventually I bit the bullet, paid big bucks, and got the Focus down to a dealer that replaced the high voltage battery cable, and fixed the problem.  But because of the logistics, it ended up being too much hassle to own this car away from a metro area with a qualified dealership.  So my suggestion to prospective buyers: make sure you live near an approved Ford dealership that works on EV\\'s, get the extended warranty that covers the drive train and electrical system, and make sure you can install a 240V electrical outlet at your home for fast charging on the car.  If you can check off all those things, and have a commute less than about 70 miles roundtrip, do not hesitate to buy this vehicle.  For around $10k it\\'s a steal!!!',\n",

Accord is a 200k mile car, the X1 is a 250k mile car (Google it).  I'm sure everything else will break on the X1 but for the money on a used one of each, I think I made the right choice by switching.

Not a great highway cars. Super loud inside compared to a typical sedan. Unsafe and roll over prone. Not many features. Gas mileage is subpar. In the north they ALL rust. And you will customize and spend more money on it. If you do not plan to make it your own, don't buy, its not for you. Even with all that said the great days are truly awesome.

The 1.5L Turbo exhibits less turbo lag than any other turbo car I have ever driven. At first I was skeptical about the CVT, however, a hatchback with a 5-speed manual was unavailable (searched a 5 state area) when I purchased in March 2017.  I was quite impressed with the performance of the CVT both in acceleration, functionality, and most of all the mileage matched with the engine. (70 mph cruise w/ A/C 38 mpg) Six years and 45K miles later (COVID kept the miles low) the car has had zero repairs other than routine maintenance. Handling is superb.

Turbo cuts in and out. This is normal for the XT in hot  conditions says the dealer service. Solution they say is to de carbon engine $500, and still has that problem, but at least it doesn't knock now. Premium fuel has always been used. Senior driver, so the car is driven gently.

The exhaust manifold cracks at the same time, must be replaced, $2,000. All brakes replaced, $742. Driver interior door lock handle breaks off, $217. A/C fails, $162.

The second generation is certainly a few steps above as far as comfort, style and driving performance. 2012 is the last year the 28i is powered by the 3.0L inline 6. Acceleration is great after getting the software update. Prior to it, I had the aggravating slow response met with a rush of acceleration. The software update has smoothed out the throttle greatly. The ride is super comfortable for day to day as well as trips. I have taken this car on long trips a few times this year and it is great on gas, very comfortable seats and great visibility. It is easy to park and has a tight turning circle. The handling feels like the 3 series sedan! Going up and down hills and mountainsides feels secure. Feature wise, I fully recommend the backup camera and parking sensors as well as the heated seats/steering wheel. Cargo space is adequate for this class and three average sized adults can fit in the backseat comfortably. I will say that BMW has this peculiar way of stripping the cars down in the past 10 years and labeling it as \"customization.\" You notice the small things such as no puddle lights on my particular car, as well as having to get packages for an improved interior/exterior. Another example is if you do not get the Navigation, you do not get the nicely done, upscale graphics on the speedometer area. You have to add leather, a sunroof, heated seats, etc. My older BMW\\'s had a lot of these more common features standard.

It feels very grounded to the road, but the steering is light and responsive.

Little to no maintenance required. \\nIt is a fully electric vehicle and at five years old, missing one battery bar, it has an estimated 81 miles per charge.  You can charge it many places for free, or you can get a subscription and charge as much as you want for $20 at certain public chargers. You can plug it into any regular outlet at home, or use special chargers that charge it a lot faster. You can install a Level 2 charger at home too (some utilities have discount programs), and it costs a lot less to own this EV than a gas car. \\nIt's a great little car with a lot of pep! It is best for driving around town, but it does have a fast charge port (Level 3) so that you can use the fast chargers up and down the interstate. Driving at high speeds for a long time and using the fast charger a lot can cause the batter to get too hot, which makes it less efficient and may even delay your trip if you aren't mindful of it - not really a problem if you keep an eye on it for big road trips, but it does take a long time to go a long distance because of stopping to charge. \\nIt is one of the safest EVs on the road too.\"]},\n",

After four years and only 50,000 miles, the problems started. At around 51,300 miles, the transmission fell apart. On the freeway, no less. We had the car fixed and the same thing happened the next year. This time, in our driveway. After getting it fixed again, my father used it for another three years before the parking brake broke. The cable literally SNAPPED. We got it fixed and then my dad gave the car to me. I would drive it to my work and back. About two years and 30,000 more miles later, a check engine light appeared. It was because there was a problem with the gas cap not being tight enough. We couldn’t fix this problem, so we ignored it. Then, we finally got rid of it a year after when the transmission died AGAIN! We got the car fixed and traded it in for a Ford Fusion. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM HONDAS!! THEY ARE UNRELIABLE!!',\n",

Transmissions/torque converters are the weak point ($5-8k) and always keep a Cam Position Sensor ($20) in the glove box with a 10mm wrench.

       "   \"I own my s8 for 1 month now. I've done an 800 mile journey and the rest (a few thousand) around town. The long journey was amazing and I felt great after.  Incredible drive.  But around town it feels like a normal car which I don't like.  It also looks like a normal car and over time it feels like it's just lost in the sea of Audi cars on the road these days.  To someone who does not know cars it just a big audi with 4 exhausts.   Unfortunately the exhaust note is non existent unless the pedal is pushed hard (when it comes to life).  I only ever hear ithe exhaust when pulling out of a T junction hard or punching the pedal on a little bit of open road.  The real problem is, I feel (as I drive 90% around town) that the lack of feedback from the car's exhaust and its very average looks and performance  (0 - 60 in 5 second is poor these days) is not worth the abismal mpg and potential servicing/repair costs. I'm getting 12 mpg coasting about town and theres no real traffic here in the north of Scotland.  Also I had a lexus ls430 b4 this and it was noticeably much smoother on the road.  It's a great car in that it feels planted on the road and the handling is amazing, and on the open road or motorway it's bonkers.  It's a car for long trips. This is where it is at its best. For around town it's too much of a gas guzzler. And if you start taking on the pocket rockets you might be dissapointed as the s8 d3 doesn't have that balistic performance the v10  badge would suggest.  But it's not just about speed it's about overall experience and it is a different driving experience with the v10.  I'm happy I bought it. It's a 4 wheel drive which I needed for the winter. It's a family car. It is an amazing car and feels like an engineering masterpiece.... but only on the open road.\",\n",

       "   \"I bought the 2015 cx5 used a few months ago with 88k miles on it. Based on my research it should last up to 300k miles with regular maintenance and non aggressive driving. I have the grand touring trim in all black. It's a very good looking vehicle inside and out. Placement of gauges is very good and buttons/functions are easy to access. Temperature functions are simple and work really well. Good venting. Windshield wipers work fine but the intermittent timer sometimes seems to fluctuate either based on speed of the car or there's something malfunctioning. I can't tell to be honest. Storage is good and there's enough pockets, compartments and spaces for personal items.  Overall the look and feel seems right on the bubble of being luxury. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe handling is on the stiffer side made to give a feel of performance which it does. I get a pretty strong connection with the road. The turns are tight. It feels good to drive and it's even fun though I don't push that. I used to have a Mazda protege in the 90's and it gave that handling excitement despite its modest power. The cx5 reminds me why I liked that car. The lag when pressing hard on the gas is a bit annoying and the 0-60 time seems a bit slow for the 184hp 2.5l engine but once it gets into it's power band it goes. Gas mileage is very good imo. I get 26 mpg combined city/highway. \\r\\n\\r\\nSeats are comfortable enough though I might have chosen the touring model for the cloth seats instead of leather because items slide off the seats and I notice some wear and stitching tears that I'll need to have repaired. The adjustments with the seats are very good I think. I like the lumbar support. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe hatchback works well but I would have appreciated an automatic open/close function. I haven't had a large hatchback before and it's a bit annoying having to force the closing if I have items in my hand. 1st world criticism certainly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest issue with this model year (and I think all models up to 2018(?) is the gps and entertainment unit. It uses the old TomTom navigation system which is very clunky and too frustrating to bother with. I use my phone instead. The entertainment system works well enough but I'm surprised it included a CD player even in 2015. I don't listen to the radio or have a Sirius subscription so I mostly Bluetooth connect my phone for streaming music and navigation. It shouldn't be necessary with an integrated system already in place but the installed system is that bad. It's all made worse by the Bluetooth tech. It often disconnects for no reason and sometimes takes a minute or longer for the system to recognize my phone. Sometimes it will be connected but there's no sound, again for no reason I can see. Usually these issues happen at start up and once I'm driving a few minutes it works fine. If I watch a video on phone there's a big latency lag from the phone to the stereo. It's big enough that it's unwatchable since a mouth moves but the sounds come later. I have to disconnect bluetooth when watching a video which is a major annoyance. I'm planning on replacing the stereo head unit in the future which hopefully will solve all these problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall it's really a great car.\",\n",

The car turns on a dime so it's easy to park and very responsive.   The few things we wish this car had are a higher center console to rest our elbow on during longer drives, non-leather seats because they feel harder/stiffer than the cloth and things slide off the seats easily; and a cargo cover.

But around town it feels like a normal car which I don't like.  It also looks like a normal car and over time it feels like it's just lost in the sea of Audi cars on the road these days.  To someone who does not know cars it just a big audi with 4 exhausts.   Unfortunately the exhaust note is non existent unless the pedal is pushed hard (when it comes to life).  I only ever hear ithe exhaust when pulling out of a T junction hard or punching the pedal on a little bit of open road.  The real problem is, I feel (as I drive 90% around town) that the lack of feedback from the car's exhaust and its very average looks and performance  (0 - 60 in 5 second is poor these days) is not worth the abismal mpg and potential servicing/repair costs. I'm getting 12 mpg coasting about town and theres no real traffic here in the north of Scotland.  Also I had a lexus ls430 b4 this and it was noticeably much smoother on the road.  It's a great car in that it feels planted on the road and the handling is amazing, and on the open road or motorway it's bonkers.  It's a car for long trips. This is where it is at its best. For around town it's too much of a gas guzzler. And if you start taking on the pocket rockets you might be dissapointed as the s8 d3 doesn't have that balistic performance the v10  badge would suggest.  But it's not just about speed it's about overall experience and it is a different driving experience with the v10.  I'm happy I bought it. It's a 4 wheel drive which I needed for the winter. It's a family car. It is an amazing car and feels like an engineering masterpiece.... but only on the open road.\",\n",

       "   'I bought the 2016 Fiat 500e in 2019, as an off-lease used car with 45,000 miles on it. As of this review I now have 49,000 miles and the car still drives and performs like a new car. The 2016 model is somewhat updated from earlier versions, I can easily drive up to 90 miles around town, or up to about 75 miles at highway speeds. The car has acceleration like a sports car and is extremely easy to drive and park just about anywhere. The interior is well designed and surprisingly spacious. For an average commuter driving typically less than 60 miles per day, this car works well and saves a lot of money by not buying gas. One of the non-advertised features is that the Fiat factory supplied charging cord can be used on 120 Volts (Level 1 charging) or 240 Volts (Level 2 charging). This means that you do not need to purchase additional expensive charging equipment to fully charge the car in about 6 hrs. This car does not have a big enough battery for long trips, but as a low maintenance, money saving commuter car, this car is truly a hidden gem in the EV market. I would highly recommend this car.',\n",

The final Pontiacs weren\\'t always the best lookers (looking at you, Aztec), but were certainly solid, reliable cars. I can\\'t imagine buying another American car after this one, not unless Pontiac is resurrected again. Thanks to my highly-effective G6, the brand would more than deserve that.']},\n",

       "   'Nightmare of a vehicle. Do not walk away from an opportunity to buy; run! My family purchased a \"CPO\" 2013 BMW X1 sDrive from a BMW dealership. I purchased it from my father in December of 2022. During mine and my father\\'s ownership the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, oil housing filter gasket, thermostat, and wheel bearings all had to be replaced before it even hit 50,000. When I went to have it inspected by an independent mechanic; it turned out all 4 bump stops had rotted out entirely, which was estimated at a $3000+ repair, simply because the entire strut assembly had to come off of the vehicle. This car was driven very carefully and never abused, yet it required $10,000+ in unexpected maintenance repairs before hitting 50,000 miles. I genuinely do not recommend anyone purchase this vehicle, as there are many more reliable and trust-worthy car brands offering cars that are actually worth investing your money into. Sold the money pit and it was the best decision I ever made. Buyers be warned.',\n",

       "   'I financed the 2012 cts4 luxury pkg in early 2021 with 50k miles on it with one previous owner and have just recently paid it off and now have fully owned this for about 6 months. This is my first vehicle, so while I have nothing to compare it to in terms of previous cars I’ve owned, I still must say this car has been absolutely amazing for me. Compared to other cars I’ve driven, including a few BMWs, Benz, etc. this one has truthfully been my favorite. The very first thing I noticed when test driving it was how insanely smooth this ride was. I was honestly blown away because I have never driven a car with this smooth of a ride. To add to this, I personally love the style. My personal vehicle is the black raven exterior with a beige interior. There is also the polished wood on doors and dash which I love. The only thing I have added to this car was the Apple CarPlay boss radio, which for me is a necessity as I can’t live without my own playlists and easy navigation. I feel like this also helped to modernize the car a bit since I do have am older model (2012). The biggest problem I had with it so far was a fuse under the hood controlling the fan which was literally a 5 min fix and costed me $60. Have not had a single problem since this fix. I have driven it about 20k miles now for about 18 months and am currently around the 70k mile range. Hopefully as there is more wear and tear it can give the same reliability and performance that I have enjoyed up to this point. Other than that, beautiful sunroof, decent amount of space in the cabin, large trunk, good acceleration, nice HP for a vehicle with no after market performance enhancers considering this car is around 300hp stock and a nice V6 engine. As I was rating this car, I was genuinely trying to think of something more constructive criticism towards it, but I truthfully have rated this vehicle to the best of my ability. Keep in mind this is from 50k-70k miles so far and this is the 2012 vehicle being rated in 2022. One last thing I would like to add considering the gas crisis that is going on as of now, this car has good mpg which is  around 20 with an 18 gallon tank. Once the low fuel alert comes on, you still have about 50 miles before gas is really in dire need. Overall, really love this vehicle and I hope that this review helps.',\n",

Cadillac says $6,500 to replace trans.  Subtle hum from rear wheel at 50+ mph turns out to be bad bearing @ $500 per wheel.  Awful DGI carbon build on intake valves (engine design flaw on all DGI regardless of manufacturer) causes rough idle at 600 rpm, and finally, a door lock actuator failure.  Man what a disappointing purchase and the dealer is “shocked, shocked I say” to learn there were problems going on in this establishment.

       "   \"I have had a 2005 Jeep Liberty Sport with the Renegade package for the last five years. I have already had to replace almost everything but the engine itself on this vehicle. Constant problems with the transmission going into limp mode make no sense when they know that the 42RLE transmission had numerous issues and was a piece of junk transmission to start with. Not acknowledging issues with the overheating of these 3.7 V6 junk engines is ridiculous. These engines are the worst then you could ever have in a jeep. I have owned two jeeps in my other Jeep had less problems than this one. First if you want me to review the interior it is absolutely terrible and uncomfortable. The seats are hard and stiff and do not move very much back and forth so if you're a tall person do not buy this car at all. If you're a short person then this car is for you. The fact that the lock button is on the side panel of the door and not the for the windows is absolutely the worst is on I have ever seen in a vehicle. Who puts the freaking when do operators in the middle panel of the car? Oh yeah Chrysler. Had to be some stupid person to think that up. It would only make sense to have everything like the windows and the door locks in one place on the door itself not anywhere else. It seems like it's a backwards system. There's no room for hardly anything in there. So if your mom this is not the car for you. As a single mom with only one child this car still is not big enough for both of us and groceries. That is how small the inside of this car is. The trunk is no better. I have including the trunk when I say the total inside of the car is completely small. Constant issues underneath the hood with the overheating I had to replace almost $2,000 worth of Parts alone this year under the hood of this piece of junk. Chrysler who makes Jeeps refuses to acknowledge the major issues with this vehicle. Including the overheating and the terrible transmission which goes into limp mode because they cannot put a quality product into a vehicle. Not to mention trying to work on your own Jeep to save some money really does nothing but agitate you because every screw bolt nut is a different size socket with no information about diagrams or anyting in the handbook for the Jeep itself. I have every original piece of paper with it. The door handles have had to be replaced due to faulty breaking of the very cheap plastic that they use on the inside to hold the door handles on. At this point I said forget it and just bolted them into the door so they don't come off anymore. If you want a piece of junk that you have to continually put all your money and then this is the vehicle for you. If you want a good vehicle don't buy the Liberty with the transmission that I mentioned as well as the 3.7 V6 piece of junk engine. The overheating problem I certainly fix that myself by removing original parts and left them off. I will not say what parts that I took off but it solved the overheating of the engine after $1,000 of replacing parts to figure out what it was. I replaced the gas cap because the code for the gas evap leak kept coming up and it still comes up despite taking it to the dealership and they said it was nothing wrong with it and so they reset it but it still comes up. So how is that not a problem? Many problems not addressed by Chrysler on these vehicles. Very poor mileage I would say I get probably 15 miles to the gallon is that. And no I do not drive fast and I do not Drive erratically either. As a single mom I have only one car and that's it and I try to take care of what I have. Yet Chrysler screwed me on this one. So no more Jeeps for me.\",\n",

       "   \"I have had a 2005 Jeep Liberty Sport with the Renegade package for the last five years. I have already had to replace almost everything but the engine itself on this vehicle. Constant problems with the transmission going into limp mode make no sense when they know that the 42RLE transmission had numerous issues and was a piece of junk transmission to start with. Not acknowledging issues with the overheating of these 3.7 V6 junk engines is ridiculous. These engines are the worst then you could ever have in a jeep. I have owned two jeeps in my other Jeep had less problems than this one. First if you want me to review the interior it is absolutely terrible and uncomfortable. The seats are hard and stiff and do not move very much back and forth so if you're a tall person do not buy this car at all. If you're a short person then this car is for you. The fact that the lock button is on the side panel of the door and not the for the windows is absolutely the worst is on I have ever seen in a vehicle. Who puts the freaking when do operators in the middle panel of the car? Oh yeah Chrysler. Had to be some stupid person to think that up. It would only make sense to have everything like the windows and the door locks in one place on the door itself not anywhere else. It seems like it's a backwards system. There's no room for hardly anything in there. So if your mom this is not the car for you. As a single mom with only one child this car still is not big enough for both of us and groceries. That is how small the inside of this car is. The trunk is no better. I have including the trunk when I say the total inside of the car is completely small. Constant issues underneath the hood with the overheating I had to replace almost $2,000 worth of Parts alone this year under the hood of this piece of junk. Chrysler who makes Jeeps refuses to acknowledge the major issues with this vehicle. Including the overheating and the terrible transmission which goes into limp mode because they cannot put a quality product into a vehicle. Not to mention trying to work on your own Jeep to save some money really does nothing but agitate you because every screw bolt nut is a different size socket with no information about diagrams or anyting in the handbook for the Jeep itself. I have every original piece of paper with it. The door handles have had to be replaced due to faulty breaking of the very cheap plastic that they use on the inside to hold the door handles on. At this point I said forget it and just bolted them into the door so they don't come off anymore. If you want a piece of junk that you have to continually put all your money and then this is the vehicle for you. If you want a good vehicle don't buy the Liberty with the transmission that I mentioned as well as the 3.7 V6 piece of junk engine. The overheating problem I certainly fix that myself by removing original parts and left them off. I will not say what parts that I took off but it solved the overheating of the engine after $1,000 of replacing parts to figure out what it was. I replaced the gas cap because the code for the gas evap leak kept coming up and it still comes up despite taking it to the dealership and they said it was nothing wrong with it and so they reset it but it still comes up. So how is that not a problem? Many problems not addressed by Chrysler on these vehicles. Very poor mileage I would say I get probably 15 miles to the gallon is that. And no I do not drive fast and I do not Drive erratically either. As a single mom I have only one car and that's it and I try to take care of what I have. Yet Chrysler screwed me on this one. So no more Jeeps for me.\",\n",

       "   'Although I have owned this 2012 VW Touareg TDI LUX SUV for only a few months, I can say that it rides and performs like no other SUV I have owned and I have had a lot of Eddie Bauers, Mountaineers and Jeeps and a Lexus.  Plus I have had a lot of sedans top to bottom.  The feeling of power and confidence in the Touareg is amazing.  It seems to like going up hills with acceleration and no sweat.  It has a smooth transmission.  Power is no problem and fuel efficiency is great too.  The real leather seating in the LUX is truly deluxe.  The seat position controls and lumbar are good.  Although the seats have a 3 person memory, it would be better if they had an automatic entry and exit positions.  This vehicle should have auto unlock or touch unlock and keyless ignition.  Also the vehicle does not support a remote starter so if you want one installed they have to wire a key under the dash to make it work.  Some of the feature controls could be easier understand how they operate.  Finally, although I love the Touareg, it was a good thing I bought a CPO warrantied vehicle.  During the first month of ownership, it was in the shop twice for almost a week each time to correct  things that were not properly done with the emissions recall.  Great handling, great ride and it makes me feel good to be behind the wheel.',\n",

I had to find a good, reliable, used car under $8,000, pay in cash, and it has to last me until I die! ☠️ My car, they stopped making, and sometimes it works, sometimes it don\\'t.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ve got at least 2 lives depending on this car! My mom is almost 87, I\\'m 47, on disability, divorced, and I don\\'t even know if my 2 teenage daughters want a relationship with me after 18. All due to my evil ex and his mommy. Even my cat\\'s life depends on this car.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, I did some research, looked at these reviews, and accidentally found my car whom I named \"Ashley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSome guy sent me 4 cars that matched what I was looking for. My eyeball went to #2. The guy said he can show it to me the next day. I stalled him cuz I was researching. So, a few days later, my mom and I went to test drive it (I already planned to buy this car). After the ride, I actually added a 2 year warranty just for peace of mind. Thank God, this was from a dealer. Good thing too, that darn engine light was increasing my anxiety. So, I took the car to AutoZone. I don\\'t think many people know this, but they can check your engine light, battery, recharge your battery and basically do a diagnostic for FREE! I went back on another day and got the same result which was the EVAP canister.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took it to my dealer and they said this looks brand new! So, I took it back one more time, they gave me a $40,000 rental car, and the next day, my car passed the DEQ test! All they did was brush off the container and drive it around, then FINALLY! No lights come on, and I just feel so blessed right now. The other 3 cars I later found out were stick. I happened to pick the only automatic. The weird thing though is the speedometer, console etc. is in the middle. So, that\\'s something I gotta get used to. The cupholders are on the left and right, but I don\\'t care. Just something to get from point A to B so I don\\'t miss appointments or emergencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ❤️ this car! I got really lucky, and adding that warranty was worth it. Oh, this had 171,000 miles, and it\\'s still going. Use at least 87 octane for gas, do those oil checks, and get the save and drive beacon from State Farm.

       "   'I just bought this car used in November 2022. Let me say it again, this car is super fun to drive. The 2013 and 2014 C300 were slightly different in horsepower from the 2008 - 2012 models. The 2013 and 2014 were the last naturally aspirated V-6 Mercedes will probably ever make. They came with 249 or almost 250 horses. The 2008 - 2012 models came with 228 horses. This car drives so smoothly, the steering is so playful and light, and when you put it in sport mode, this thing turns into a little beast. It flies through bends and corners and rides on rails. If you drive it aggressively, you can never get enough of this car. And, the exhaust growls too. I was so lucky to get the 2014 model with the darkened wheels with tires bulging out of the fenders. Those can be harder to find. I was so lucky to find one. What I paid was comparable to the prices on Cars.com. It is a remarkable car that feels luxurious but then can get very aggressive slightly beyond your imagination. And, after my research, they had very little problems. They were super reliable. This was the first car i had driven in the modern age with no NHTSA recall. That blew my mind away because almost all the manufacturers now have one NHTSA ding or the other. Mine was black on black with dark wheels (C300 Sport) bulging out of the fenders. Really aggressive looking beautiful car. I love it. I would get the version that says Sport.',\n",

The 2016 model is somewhat updated from earlier versions, I can easily drive up to 90 miles around town, or up to about 75 miles at highway speeds. The car has acceleration like a sports car and is extremely easy to drive and park just about anywhere. The interior is well designed and surprisingly spacious. For an average commuter driving typically less than 60 miles per day, this car works well and saves a lot of money by not buying gas. One of the non-advertised features is that the Fiat factory supplied charging cord can be used on 120 Volts (Level 1 charging) or 240 Volts (Level 2 charging). This means that you do not need to purchase additional expensive charging equipment to fully charge the car in about 6 hrs. This car does not have a big enough battery for long trips, but as a low maintenance, money saving commuter car, this car is truly a hidden gem in the EV market.

       "   'I financed the 2012 cts4 luxury pkg in early 2021 with 50k miles on it with one previous owner and have just recently paid it off and now have fully owned this for about 6 months. This is my first vehicle, so while I have nothing to compare it to in terms of previous cars I’ve owned, I still must say this car has been absolutely amazing for me. Compared to other cars I’ve driven, including a few BMWs, Benz, etc. this one has truthfully been my favorite. The very first thing I noticed when test driving it was how insanely smooth this ride was. I was honestly blown away because I have never driven a car with this smooth of a ride. To add to this, I personally love the style. My personal vehicle is the black raven exterior with a beige interior. There is also the polished wood on doors and dash which I love. The only thing I have added to this car was the Apple CarPlay boss radio, which for me is a necessity as I can’t live without my own playlists and easy navigation. I feel like this also helped to modernize the car a bit since I do have am older model (2012). The biggest problem I had with it so far was a fuse under the hood controlling the fan which was literally a 5 min fix and costed me $60. Have not had a single problem since this fix. I have driven it about 20k miles now for about 18 months and am currently around the 70k mile range. Hopefully as there is more wear and tear it can give the same reliability and performance that I have enjoyed up to this point. Other than that, beautiful sunroof, decent amount of space in the cabin, large trunk, good acceleration, nice HP for a vehicle with no after market performance enhancers considering this car is around 300hp stock and a nice V6 engine. As I was rating this car, I was genuinely trying to think of something more constructive criticism towards it, but I truthfully have rated this vehicle to the best of my ability. Keep in mind this is from 50k-70k miles so far and this is the 2012 vehicle being rated in 2022. One last thing I would like to add considering the gas crisis that is going on as of now, this car has good mpg which is  around 20 with an 18 gallon tank. Once the low fuel alert comes on, you still have about 50 miles before gas is really in dire need. Overall, really love this vehicle and I hope that this review helps.',\n",

       "   \"I have had a 2005 Jeep Liberty Sport with the Renegade package for the last five years. I have already had to replace almost everything but the engine itself on this vehicle. Constant problems with the transmission going into limp mode make no sense when they know that the 42RLE transmission had numerous issues and was a piece of junk transmission to start with. Not acknowledging issues with the overheating of these 3.7 V6 junk engines is ridiculous. These engines are the worst then you could ever have in a jeep. I have owned two jeeps in my other Jeep had less problems than this one. First if you want me to review the interior it is absolutely terrible and uncomfortable. The seats are hard and stiff and do not move very much back and forth so if you're a tall person do not buy this car at all. If you're a short person then this car is for you. The fact that the lock button is on the side panel of the door and not the for the windows is absolutely the worst is on I have ever seen in a vehicle. Who puts the freaking when do operators in the middle panel of the car? Oh yeah Chrysler. Had to be some stupid person to think that up. It would only make sense to have everything like the windows and the door locks in one place on the door itself not anywhere else. It seems like it's a backwards system. There's no room for hardly anything in there. So if your mom this is not the car for you. As a single mom with only one child this car still is not big enough for both of us and groceries. That is how small the inside of this car is. The trunk is no better. I have including the trunk when I say the total inside of the car is completely small. Constant issues underneath the hood with the overheating I had to replace almost $2,000 worth of Parts alone this year under the hood of this piece of junk. Chrysler who makes Jeeps refuses to acknowledge the major issues with this vehicle. Including the overheating and the terrible transmission which goes into limp mode because they cannot put a quality product into a vehicle. Not to mention trying to work on your own Jeep to save some money really does nothing but agitate you because every screw bolt nut is a different size socket with no information about diagrams or anyting in the handbook for the Jeep itself. I have every original piece of paper with it. The door handles have had to be replaced due to faulty breaking of the very cheap plastic that they use on the inside to hold the door handles on. At this point I said forget it and just bolted them into the door so they don't come off anymore. If you want a piece of junk that you have to continually put all your money and then this is the vehicle for you. If you want a good vehicle don't buy the Liberty with the transmission that I mentioned as well as the 3.7 V6 piece of junk engine. The overheating problem I certainly fix that myself by removing original parts and left them off. I will not say what parts that I took off but it solved the overheating of the engine after $1,000 of replacing parts to figure out what it was. I replaced the gas cap because the code for the gas evap leak kept coming up and it still comes up despite taking it to the dealership and they said it was nothing wrong with it and so they reset it but it still comes up. So how is that not a problem? Many problems not addressed by Chrysler on these vehicles. Very poor mileage I would say I get probably 15 miles to the gallon is that. And no I do not drive fast and I do not Drive erratically either. As a single mom I have only one car and that's it and I try to take care of what I have. Yet Chrysler screwed me on this one. So no more Jeeps for me.\",\n",

I have an 18 month old and 2 nieces I pick up daily from daycare/Kindergarten and they have a ton more room in the second row of my CX-5 then they did in my Subaru Forester. The hatch is also much bigger which allows me to take my sons full-sized stroller with me, if need be, on our outings. I absolutely love all the features. The only thing I wish it had was more pep. Don't get me wrong. It moves, but I am so used to driving turboed cars. (I also own a worked 2004 Subaru WRX that i LOVE!) so this thing not being the 2.5T is the only downside. However, without the turbo I don't need premium gas, so I know I am saving in the long haul. And, on that note, the gas mileage is fantastic. I was recently getting 20.1 mpg city driving and I can't ask for anything better because that is what I do most of. I love this car and will definitely be sticking with Mazda's for my new daily drivers!\"]},\n",

       "   'Although I have owned this 2012 VW Touareg TDI LUX SUV for only a few months, I can say that it rides and performs like no other SUV I have owned and I have had a lot of Eddie Bauers, Mountaineers and Jeeps and a Lexus.  Plus I have had a lot of sedans top to bottom.  The feeling of power and confidence in the Touareg is amazing.  It seems to like going up hills with acceleration and no sweat.  It has a smooth transmission.  Power is no problem and fuel efficiency is great too.  The real leather seating in the LUX is truly deluxe.  The seat position controls and lumbar are good.  Although the seats have a 3 person memory, it would be better if they had an automatic entry and exit positions.  This vehicle should have auto unlock or touch unlock and keyless ignition.  Also the vehicle does not support a remote starter so if you want one installed they have to wire a key under the dash to make it work.  Some of the feature controls could be easier understand how they operate.  Finally, although I love the Touareg, it was a good thing I bought a CPO warrantied vehicle.  During the first month of ownership, it was in the shop twice for almost a week each time to correct  things that were not properly done with the emissions recall.  Great handling, great ride and it makes me feel good to be behind the wheel.',\n",

I purchased it from my father in December of 2022. During mine and my father\\'s ownership the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, oil housing filter gasket, thermostat, and wheel bearings all had to be replaced before it even hit 50,000. When I went to have it inspected by an independent mechanic; it turned out all 4 bump stops had rotted out entirely, which was estimated at a $3000+ repair, simply because the entire strut assembly had to come off of the vehicle. This car was driven very carefully and never abused, yet it required $10,000+ in unexpected maintenance repairs before hitting 50,000 miles. I genuinely do not recommend anyone purchase this vehicle, as there are many more reliable and trust-worthy car brands offering cars that are actually worth investing your money into.

In that one year, the vehicle was constantly in and out of the dealership for repairs until it finally gave out at 100,500 miles! I purchased it Certified Pre-Owned. And wouldn't ya know, even at just over the PT warranty, Chevy would do nothing about it despite numerous visits to the shop for every issue under the sun. So the car sat at the dealership/shop for months while we faithfully paid on our loan and tried to save up money for a new engine or down payment for a car. We were stuck! We ended up having to roll the rest of this loan into a new Chevy Traverse just so we could get a car. We’re paying way too much for this new one but we couldn’t rationalize paying $6-7k for a new engine that would be the same 2009 hunk of junk already in there giving us problems. Once I can get rid of the one I’m in, I’m done with Chevy. The one we have now is nothing but problems too. We’ve never had this many issues! Most of our cars last us 300k+ miles easy (my husband’s Ford truck is running good at 294k right now).\\nFTR if you google the 2009 Chevy, you’ll see the engine shutting down at just over 100k is a common problem.

       "   'I financed the 2012 cts4 luxury pkg in early 2021 with 50k miles on it with one previous owner and have just recently paid it off and now have fully owned this for about 6 months. This is my first vehicle, so while I have nothing to compare it to in terms of previous cars I’ve owned, I still must say this car has been absolutely amazing for me. Compared to other cars I’ve driven, including a few BMWs, Benz, etc. this one has truthfully been my favorite. The very first thing I noticed when test driving it was how insanely smooth this ride was. I was honestly blown away because I have never driven a car with this smooth of a ride. To add to this, I personally love the style. My personal vehicle is the black raven exterior with a beige interior. There is also the polished wood on doors and dash which I love. The only thing I have added to this car was the Apple CarPlay boss radio, which for me is a necessity as I can’t live without my own playlists and easy navigation. I feel like this also helped to modernize the car a bit since I do have am older model (2012). The biggest problem I had with it so far was a fuse under the hood controlling the fan which was literally a 5 min fix and costed me $60. Have not had a single problem since this fix. I have driven it about 20k miles now for about 18 months and am currently around the 70k mile range. Hopefully as there is more wear and tear it can give the same reliability and performance that I have enjoyed up to this point. Other than that, beautiful sunroof, decent amount of space in the cabin, large trunk, good acceleration, nice HP for a vehicle with no after market performance enhancers considering this car is around 300hp stock and a nice V6 engine. As I was rating this car, I was genuinely trying to think of something more constructive criticism towards it, but I truthfully have rated this vehicle to the best of my ability. Keep in mind this is from 50k-70k miles so far and this is the 2012 vehicle being rated in 2022. One last thing I would like to add considering the gas crisis that is going on as of now, this car has good mpg which is  around 20 with an 18 gallon tank. Once the low fuel alert comes on, you still have about 50 miles before gas is really in dire need. Overall, really love this vehicle and I hope that this review helps.',\n",

Cadillac says $6,500 to replace trans.  Subtle hum from rear wheel at 50+ mph turns out to be bad bearing @ $500 per wheel.  Awful DGI carbon build on intake valves (engine design flaw on all DGI regardless of manufacturer) causes rough idle at 600 rpm, and finally, a door lock actuator failure.  Man what a disappointing purchase and the dealer is “shocked, shocked I say” to learn there were problems going on in this establishment.

TLDR, very little other cars give you this much fun without sacrificing functionality, reliability, mileage, or comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoesn\\'t get terrible mileage as long as you don\\'t drive it like a maniac. Put\\'s mustangs and some chargers/challengers to shame. Has a lot of grip, but steering is numb and very light. Has a bit of rev hang. Leather seats are very comfortable, but the suspension is a bit bumpy at times (its not a german luxury car so its not a big deal). Shifter feels a wee bit numb, but cause it has rubber bushings. Manual transmission has very aggressive gearing, 1st doesn\\'t need any throttle at all to get going and can at time start in 2nd, 80mph @ 3000rpm in 6th. E-Brake handle feels super cheap, but it is a honda so o big deal. Doors are nice and long, giving great visibility. Back end looks super sexy. V6 sounds like pure sex, especially at 4900rpm and up (VTEC range), redlines about 7000rpm, has lots of torque so you can pass in 6th on the highway very easily. MPG is listed at 18/28 but you can realistically get a bit more than 30 on the highway if you use cruise control or don\\'t drive too fast (65-75). Back seats fit up to 3 average sized adults for trips not too long, great rearseat room for a coupe. Auto-dimming rearview mirror is a blessing, and blindspot camera (if yours has it) is very useful. Trunk is pretty spacious, with back seats down it can easily fit skis or snowboards and other long but not too wide cargo cause it has a chokepoint between the trunk and the seats which limits width. Handling is great, but you don\\'t get any feedback from the steering wheel and steering is super light (electric pwsteering). Body doesn\\'t roll too much in corners. in my opinion, VERY UNDERBRAKED. Brakes are not nearly big enough for the power this car has. Good for normal use but driving at a track or in Mexico at 100mph+ the brakes fade extremely quickly and lose stopping power, then begin to warp a bit (goes a way after a while but sucks in the moment) I had a couple \"Oh xxxx\" moments underestimating the brakes due to them being hot. User beware. Get some LED headlights if it doesn\\'t come with any, the halogen bulbs are pretty weak. FCW (front collision warning) is very annoying and too sensitive at the lowest setting so turn that off. ECO mode is absolutely a must, it does NOT limit power it just makes the already sensitive throttle more linear and natural feeling, saving vital MPG during normal driving. Pedals are kind of small so harder to heel-toe in normal or more narrow shoes. You will have to replace tires often cause burnouts are so easy and fun even possible up to 3rd (joking obviously). \\r\\n\\r\\nIF skeptical, BUY ONE! just make sure it was taken care of, but you will have tons of fun while still being able to daily it every day for a trillion miles cause the Honda J35 runs for centuries (the ones without cylinder deactivation). DONT LET FWD DEALBREAK YOU! it still drives and handles amazingly. \\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion: amazing daily for enthusiasts looking for a good combo of fun, comfort, reliability.',\n",

My dogs love the midgate, as do I when I need full sheets, 2x4's and other materials.  I have hauled 16' 2x4's without needing to worry about how far behind me it hands. Towing feels like driving normal, and i often forget i have a trailer. Living in the northeast, I drive in the snow a lot. With the stock tires,  I drove the speed limit with no issue, unless there was ice. With the beefy goodyear wrangler duratrac tires, I drive through mud that scrapes the belly and never get stuck. Speaking of, the ground clearance is surprisingly good. I have a fully loaded LTZ, and the auto leveling (I forgot the name of the option) is very helpful out in the woods. The only downside is that the traction control can not be fully disengaged unless you are in 4x4 low. I turned off the traction control when I need wheel spin (if you live in snow, you understand end of driveways), yet it still stopped my tires from spinning when I was halfway in the road, and I had to back into my driveway on a few occasions.

Beyond that, isn\\'t it just whipped cream on top? ;-)\\r\\n\\r\\nI use my G6 for gig work (UberEATs, etc) and while it\\'s had some needed repairs (particularly with the suspension and the steering, the weakest part of the car imo), it\\'s the drivetrain has continued to impress and push through all the suspension drama (like a control arm simply tearing in half from 16 years of corrosion in Midwestern winters).\\r\\n\\r\\nPerformance-wise, it\\'s really a sleeper vehicle, for sure.

It\\'s not going to win any drag races, but it\\'s more than capable in your everyday driving scenarios (and flat-out excellent in rainy conditions, with the right tires).\\r\\n\\r\\nI would say the handling has been the most disappointing element of the car, even with the \\'07 models mostly now having hydraulic steering (vs the crappy electric steering that was relegated to the cheapest models by \\'07). The turning radius feels quite big for a car that isn\\'t too huge like the G6...feels like I\\'m still trying to park my first car, an old-style \\'90 Mercury Grand Marquis, which had 2 full feet of length more than my G6. That said, these issues largely disappear on the road, and the car is very \"compliant\" on the highway.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, it\\'s a real tragedy that Pontiac is no more: I think the G6/G8 line was a fantastic offering by 2007/2008, the brand simply ran out of time thanks to GM mismanagement. The final Pontiacs weren\\'t always the best lookers (looking at you, Aztec), but were certainly solid, reliable cars.

Although the seats have a 3 person memory, it would be better if they had an automatic entry and exit positions.  This vehicle should have auto unlock or touch unlock and keyless ignition.  Also the vehicle does not support a remote starter so if you want one installed they have to wire a key under the dash to make it work.  Some of the feature controls could be easier understand how they operate.  Finally, although I love the Touareg, it was a good thing I bought a CPO warrantied vehicle.  During the first month of ownership, it was in the shop twice for almost a week each time to correct  things that were not properly done with the emissions recall.

       "   'the 2012 Hyundai Sonata is a smooth comfortable car with a potential flaw that Hyundai has, in my opinion, addressed adequately.  First the Pros:  It is stylish in both the interior as well as exterior design.  It is comfortable, even for me at 6\\'3\" and is not tiring for extended periods on the highway.  The fuel economy is good averaging for me about 32 MPG with mostly highway driving.  The engine has reasonable power when needed and is generally smooth.  The cons are that the 4-cylinder Theta-II engine that the Sonata Uses, (as well as the Santa Fe and Kia Optima and Sorento) has a known flaw that causes the #4 cylinder connecting rod bearing to wear out prematurely causing engine failure.  Hyundai has recently extended the Engine Warranty to a lifetime warranty on these engines and that includes if you bought the car used.  I think this is a reasonable response.  My Sonata suffered this exact failure 5 months ago at 164,000 miles and the engine was replaced with no pushback.  The car carried an original 100K mile warranty which is still considered industry leading so, legally, any car over 100K miles Hyundai and Kia could have stuck to their original warranty agreement and taken no action.  But that is not what they are doing.  One of the reasons I gave Korean cars a try several years ago was the lack of response I got on a Japanese brand known for their high quality that also had a known failure point but took no action after the warranty expired.  Because of Hyundai\\'s ultimate response I still highly recommend the car.  if you have a higher mileage Sonata, my advice would be sure you have some sort of roadside assistance, so in case you experience this same failure, you will not be left stranded.  The good news is that in the rare instance you experience this issue, you should receive a new engine.',\n",

We had the car fixed and the same thing happened the next year. This time, in our driveway. After getting it fixed again, my father used it for another three years before the parking brake broke. The cable literally SNAPPED. We got it fixed and then my dad gave the car to me. I would drive it to my work and back. About two years and 30,000 more miles later, a check engine light appeared. It was because there was a problem with the gas cap not being tight enough. We couldn’t fix this problem, so we ignored it. Then, we finally got rid of it a year after when the transmission died AGAIN! We got the car fixed and traded it in for a Ford Fusion. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM HONDAS!! THEY ARE UNRELIABLE!!',\n",

Plus I have had a lot of sedans top to bottom.  The feeling of power and confidence in the Touareg is amazing.  It seems to like going up hills with acceleration and no sweat.  It has a smooth transmission.  Power is no problem and fuel efficiency is great too.  The real leather seating in the LUX is truly deluxe.  The seat position controls and lumbar are good.  Although the seats have a 3 person memory, it would be better if they had an automatic entry and exit positions.  This vehicle should have auto unlock or touch unlock and keyless ignition.  Also the vehicle does not support a remote starter so if you want one installed they have to wire a key under the dash to make it work.  Some of the feature controls could be easier understand how they operate.  Finally, although I love the Touareg, it was a good thing I bought a CPO warrantied vehicle.  During the first month of ownership, it was in the shop twice for almost a week each time to correct  things that were not properly done with the emissions recall.

This car has had very minimal problems and/or problems that can be fixed at home. It has about 300k on it now and is still going strong. However it does has a transmission problem but almost all cars eventually, the transmissions go bad. However, everyone’s opinion my differ depending on the condition the car is when bought. If the car was not maintained before you will definitely see more problems. One thing I do dislike is how the car is not as heavy and sometimes if it is windy you may feel the car get pushed a little. But, overall this car will last you a long time, even when buying it with a bit of mileage on it. It’s has a very nice vintage look to it and so much fun to drive. Absolutely no blind spots and is very easy to see out of. The car is really spacious and super comfortable. Also they are pretty easy to work on  and you can take it to a trust mechanic that won’t charge you a fortune like most dealerships. It accelerates very nicely. It’s a great everyday drive. It’s crazy sometimes to see that even though these cars are over 20 years old they are still on the road. The engine in this car is definitely one of the best Jeep has ever made. I would definitely recommend this to someone who has an eye for 90s vintage cars and is looking for something older but still reliable.']},\n",

This car has had very minimal problems and/or problems that can be fixed at home. It has about 300k on it now and is still going strong. However it does has a transmission problem but almost all cars eventually, the transmissions go bad. However, everyone’s opinion my differ depending on the condition the car is when bought. If the car was not maintained before you will definitely see more problems. One thing I do dislike is how the car is not as heavy and sometimes if it is windy you may feel the car get pushed a little. But, overall this car will last you a long time, even when buying it with a bit of mileage on it. It’s has a very nice vintage look to it and so much fun to drive. Absolutely no blind spots and is very easy to see out of. The car is really spacious and super comfortable. Also they are pretty easy to work on  and you can take it to a trust mechanic that won’t charge you a fortune like most dealerships. It accelerates very nicely. It’s a great everyday drive. It’s crazy sometimes to see that even though these cars are over 20 years old they are still on the road. The engine in this car is definitely one of the best Jeep has ever made. I would definitely recommend this to someone who has an eye for 90s vintage cars and is looking for something older but still reliable.']},\n",

       "   \"Update to 3/2/23 review: the 2016 Ford Fusion SE with the 1.6L EcoBoost engine has a major problem: a design flaw with the coolant/antifreeze channels in the EcoBoost engines (including the 1.5L and 2.0L EcoBoost engines, through 2019) eventually results in engine coolant leaking into the cylinders. The only solution, per Ford, is to replace the engine. I was quoted $9,000 for the small engine block replacement, but the dealer recommended replacing the whole engine (stated the small block replacement doesn't last) at $12,000! Otherwise, I really like this car. It didn't act up when I bought it used, but then the telltale signs of this engine flaw started: the Check Engine light came on (fault codes P0302, P0304, and P0300 all indicate engine cylinder misfires, which are a symptom of the coolant leak) when the engine started running rough periodically, then more often. Both a local independent repair shop and the Ford dealer confirmed the problem and 'solution'. The car isn't worth the cost of the repair and Ford has not fully acknowledged the problem. The vehicles should be recalled and the engines replaced.\",\n",

The only solution, per Ford, is to replace the engine. I was quoted $9,000 for the small engine block replacement, but the dealer recommended replacing the whole engine (stated the small block replacement doesn't last) at $12,000! Otherwise, I really like this car. It didn't act up when I bought it used, but then the telltale signs of this engine flaw started: the Check Engine light came on (fault codes P0302, P0304, and P0300 all indicate engine cylinder misfires, which are a symptom of the coolant leak) when the engine started running rough periodically, then more often. Both a local independent repair shop and the Ford dealer confirmed the problem and 'solution'. The car isn't worth the cost of the repair and Ford has not fully acknowledged the problem. The vehicles should be recalled and the engines replaced.\",\n",

For being a truck that is almost 20 years old, the paint is faded in some spots and the dash where the speaker in the center was brittle and busted but, it was my fault it got busted. Anyways so far all the problems i have had since i have had it are that both the exhaust manifolds are leaking, which is very common on these trucks but, doesn’t effect it at all, runs just fine. It sprung a small oil leak from the oil cooler, easy fix. Had to replace both front hub bearings. And just before I bought it, the previous owner just replaced the radiator due to leak. So nothing major and has never left me stranded. Still has no rust. Everything works in it, the 19 year old Rockford Fasgate stereo system still sounds great. Sunroof still works, tv still works. I tell you everything works. Knock on wood for all of this, has been a very reliable truck. The 2 top things I would change in this truck if I could would be to give it more comfortable seats (not the most comfy but, not horrible either) and give it better gas mileage, low end I get about 12.5 mpg, high end 14.5 mpg. Not a gas saver by any means but, great truck all around. Pray it keeps being the reliable truck that it is.',\n",

Bought this 2009 model (manufactured april 2008) with 86,000 miles on the odometer almost 2 years ago, in good shape. Interior is, for european standards, very spacious, though trunk space is not big and you cannot just fold the rear seats to increase trunk space. These are the only critics I have. The car drives very smooth and you only hear the sound of the tyres in the background. I do not bother to use the radio system as i enjoy driving this quite car. Often I just take her for a spin for relaxation. Incredible experience because I used to be fined periodically for speeding. Now I just don't bother to hurry for whatever reason. Maintenance is quite easy, except of course for the hybrid battery. Much of the work is do it yourself. Contrary to complaints elsewhere my engine does not consume much oil at all. Perhaps 1 liter in 5000 miles. which is o.k. for this senior citizen. As I grew older I also  started to drink a little more than when I led a sporty life. To date I am very satisfied with this car. My previous cars were Renault Safrane, Renault 25 V6, Lancia Thema Turbo, Lancia Thema i.e. 16V, and this one is, so far, the best one. I do hope it will match the life time of both of my Renaults (20 years, 150 k miles). Petrol consumption is excellent with 38 MPG, mostly in urban areas.

Nissan extended (on paper) the transmission warranty to 100,000 miles (due to a radiator leak defect) but didn\\'t cover our failure even though we reported intermitant problems at 97,000 - it failed at 100,100. Nissan refused to warrant it! The computer inside the transmission had failed causing it to shift incorrectly, damaging a gear. It cost about $3,700 to have it repaired by local shop - Nissan wanted about $7,000! There was only 1 part in the entire country and we had to wait over a week to get it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo other real issues other than individual coil packs failing at 180,000 (cylinder 1), 240,000 (cylinder 3) and 275,000 (cylinder 5). The repairs for cylinders 1 & 3 cost about $60 for the part and about 20 minutes of labor - but cylinder 5 requires removing the intake to get to it and that cost about $350.\\r\\n\\r\\nFun to drive but mileage sucks! It handles great because it is very stiff (rides like a truck) and the v6 has some \\'guts\".

Too bus angled, not enough drop down.  And a lever for adjustment?  The RX's automatic wheel beats this all day long.\\r\\nThe wheel controls, such as cruise control are not on a stalk.  The switches themselves are hard to use.  \\r\\nMine has the Elite package, but has no power liftgate.  C'mon Lincoln, this is standard on the Lexus.\\r\\nDashboard buttons are also not very intuitive, but the RX is guilty of this, as well.\\r\\nAwesomeness not found on the Lexus:  heated and cooled perforated leather seats, the panoramic sunroof - very cool, dual exhaust (although it's a split single), keyless entry pad on driver door - love it!\\r\\nAwesomeness not found on the MKX:  build quality,fit and finish are nowhere near the RX.  Reliability suffers from maladies and recalls around the airbags, gas tank, water pump, throttle body, and poor braking performance.  Paint quality is poor compared to the RX.\\r\\nOne big plus for the MKX is a V6 engine that makes equivalent power to the Lexus on regular gas. \\r\\nThe market right now puts the RX at about $4K more than the MKX for a similar year, and with 20-30K more mileage!  So a well-kept MKX can be a better value.    \\r\\nIt's obvious some MKX things are compromises owing to the fact that it's a dolled-up Edge, where the RX is its own model.  Both vehicles are attractive (before Lexus went nuts with their styling in later years), but I find this first-gen MKX very handsome.

Now the CONS- cheap interior plastic design compared to other competitors trucks, can run regular gas but its recommended to use mid grade or premium for all around fuel efficiency and engine life, do not use engine fuel/ octane boosters! all aluminum engine is good but bad if it runs to hot for to long as your heads will warp. rough ride compared to other trucks. other than that this truck is as solid as they come.

We would NOT recommend a king cab but the overall value was to good to pass up. The 2014 has dual climate control which our 2005 didn\\'t. We expect everything else to be similar and having now used it for 5,000 miles, that appears to be true.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe purchased a used 2005 Nissan Frontier King cab with 95,000 miles and drove it until it had 280,000 miles. Nissan extended (on paper) the transmission warranty to 100,000 miles (due to a radiator leak defect) but didn\\'t cover our failure even though we reported intermitant problems at 97,000 - it failed at 100,100. Nissan refused to warrant it! The computer inside the transmission had failed causing it to shift incorrectly, damaging a gear. It cost about $3,700 to have it repaired by local shop - Nissan wanted about $7,000! There was only 1 part in the entire country and we had to wait over a week to get it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo other real issues other than individual coil packs failing at 180,000 (cylinder 1), 240,000 (cylinder 3) and 275,000 (cylinder 5). The repairs for cylinders 1 & 3 cost about $60 for the part and about 20 minutes of labor - but cylinder 5 requires removing the intake to get to it and that cost about $350.\\r\\n\\r\\nFun to drive but mileage sucks! It handles great because it is very stiff (rides like a truck) and the v6 has some \\'guts\". ALWAYS starts, even at -30 (using synthetic oil changed spring and fall).\\r\\n\\r\\nNissan needs to fix issues with poor headlights (compared to other manufacturers), gas gage reading wrong just after warranty, climate controls not effective, and evaporator (emissions system) failing happened in 3 out of 5 Nissans we owned and 2 had tecalls) since these same problems have occurred in several of our Nissan vehicals - not just the 2005 Frontier.\\r\\nNissans will typically rust before other brands.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have also owned 2 Nissan Maximas and a Nissan Altima.

Right off the back, dealer needed to update the software because the door locks didn’t work when shifting to drive/ park. Panoramic sunroof rattles like no other. 10+ visits to the dealer for this issue, eventually reached a settlement with Kia. No resolution. Engine has been extremely reliable until about 70k miles.

Line replacement is 300 a pc, probably looking at a 1000 repair.  5 years later with the vehicle, it still looks sharp. It’s quick on its feet, it sounds good, and it’s extremely comfortable. A great car for the right person. I am considering trading the car in because I am afraid of what the maintenance future holds on this vehicle.

       "   'Back in 2010, my father traded his 2009 Hemi Orange R/T challenger in on a brand new 2011 Yellow Blaze Fiesta 5 door hatch with every option on it except for the automatic transmission. Sunroof, leather seats, upgraded sound system, you name it. It was truly one of a kind and to this day I’ve still never seen one like it. I’ve seen a few other yellow blazes but never one with the options ours had. In 2017, he gave it to me as my first car. It had 50,000 miles at the time. I learned how to drive stick on it! The car isn’t the fastest thing in the world, but it sure is a blast to drive. They handle wonderfully. I quickly fell in love with this car and called her the Highlighter. My dad helped me install Rockford fosgate speakers in her, a 12” Rockford fosgate punch p3 subwoofer and a kicker 800w amp. She bumped! I loved her even more after this. I had countless first dates in her until I met the woman I thought I was going to marry and was with her for two short years before that fell apart. I drove her hard, very hard. My foot was on the floor practically everywhere I went, sliding her around any and every corner. She took it all. I did this for 80,000 more miles. She reached 130,000 miles and needed a timing belt change, so we decided we would do that ourselves. Mind you, this car never needed work, it never failed to start on me, never threw codes, always got me where I needed to go safe and sound and I never worried about it not starting. So doing this timing belt change was honestly some of the first work we had to do to this car other than brakes, oil changes, and a serpentine belt at 80,000 miles. In the process of us locking the flywheel, the special tool to do so broke and made its way inside the transmission somewhere. We couldn’t get it out; but we were able to get her back together running just fine once again. However, while under the car trying to get that part out, we noticed something. On the manual transmission fiestas, there tends to be a problem with a transmission oil leak when your clutch starts to go out. This was a stock clutch with 130,000 miles on it, driven by me, a teenager at the time. There’s no way it should’ve made it as long as it did with the abuse it took, but it did. It’s almost $3,000 to have a new clutch installed in one of these cars, which essentially totals the car out. I had to make the decision to either keep the fiesta and dump its value into it to fix it when it was already up there in miles, or trade it in on an ecoboost mustang. I decided to trade her because ford wouldn’t be able to fix her for a couple of months and I was moving for college so I needed a car. I stand by my word, that fiesta will forever be the most reliable car I will have ever owned. It took so much more than any other car should’ve or would’ve. Truly one of the best cars in the world in my eyes. The mpg is just a plus on top of the reliability of these things. I’ll forever miss my fiesta, I had such a sentimental attachment to this car that I don’t think anyone will ever understand. But I hope the right person is reading this and if you’re debating getting one, get it. You wont regret it. I miss mine more and more everyday. That ecoboost mustang is cool and all, but it’ll never be my fiesta. My fiesta made so many memories with me from whether it was being the clown car trying to cram all my friends into her even though her carry capacity is 800lbs, or from those first dates previously mentioned. She was known around town because I was involved in the car scene and took her everywhere. I was proud of my fiesta. You would be too. I really hope I see mine out there on day again. If you happen to have a debadged 2011 yellow blaze 5-speed manual fiesta hatch with 127,000+ miles, you may have my baby and I hope she treats you well.',\n",

       "   \"Update to 3/2/23 review: the 2016 Ford Fusion SE with the 1.6L EcoBoost engine has a major problem: a design flaw with the coolant/antifreeze channels in the EcoBoost engines (including the 1.5L and 2.0L EcoBoost engines, through 2019) eventually results in engine coolant leaking into the cylinders. The only solution, per Ford, is to replace the engine. I was quoted $9,000 for the small engine block replacement, but the dealer recommended replacing the whole engine (stated the small block replacement doesn't last) at $12,000! Otherwise, I really like this car. It didn't act up when I bought it used, but then the telltale signs of this engine flaw started: the Check Engine light came on (fault codes P0302, P0304, and P0300 all indicate engine cylinder misfires, which are a symptom of the coolant leak) when the engine started running rough periodically, then more often. Both a local independent repair shop and the Ford dealer confirmed the problem and 'solution'. The car isn't worth the cost of the repair and Ford has not fully acknowledged the problem. The vehicles should be recalled and the engines replaced.\",\n",

We would NOT recommend a king cab but the overall value was to good to pass up. The 2014 has dual climate control which our 2005 didn\\'t. We expect everything else to be similar and having now used it for 5,000 miles, that appears to be true.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe purchased a used 2005 Nissan Frontier King cab with 95,000 miles and drove it until it had 280,000 miles. Nissan extended (on paper) the transmission warranty to 100,000 miles (due to a radiator leak defect) but didn\\'t cover our failure even though we reported intermitant problems at 97,000 - it failed at 100,100. Nissan refused to warrant it! The computer inside the transmission had failed causing it to shift incorrectly, damaging a gear. It cost about $3,700 to have it repaired by local shop - Nissan wanted about $7,000! There was only 1 part in the entire country and we had to wait over a week to get it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo other real issues other than individual coil packs failing at 180,000 (cylinder 1), 240,000 (cylinder 3) and 275,000 (cylinder 5). The repairs for cylinders 1 & 3 cost about $60 for the part and about 20 minutes of labor - but cylinder 5 requires removing the intake to get to it and that cost about $350.\\r\\n\\r\\nFun to drive but mileage sucks! It handles great because it is very stiff (rides like a truck) and the v6 has some \\'guts\". ALWAYS starts, even at -30 (using synthetic oil changed spring and fall).\\r\\n\\r\\nNissan needs to fix issues with poor headlights (compared to other manufacturers), gas gage reading wrong just after warranty, climate controls not effective, and evaporator (emissions system) failing happened in 3 out of 5 Nissans we owned and 2 had tecalls) since these same problems have occurred in several of our Nissan vehicals - not just the 2005 Frontier.\\r\\nNissans will typically rust before other brands.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have also owned 2 Nissan Maximas and a Nissan Altima.

If you do what Jaguar recommends, you will have a very reliable, and in my case, a very fast performance sedan. Some of my car buddies  laughed when I decided to buy a 13 year old Supercharged Jag with 24K miles. The last year of the famed Jag 4.2 V8, supercharged, which takes it from 300 hp to 420 hp, stock. 6-months later, with 32K miles, she still purrs like a kitten, of course, the 370Z Nismo that goaded me into a straight line drag race thought he would smoke an old man sedan. Wrong.  From 0-60 he beat me by just under a car length, but, from 60MPH onward, the Jag rocketed past him for an overall 2+ car length victory.  This engine is amazing with the eaton supercharger. It is a highway cruiser. Built for long, long rides.  I have had it on 3 long trips of 1200+ miles and averaged 22.4 mpg. Make sure you have a service center that knows how to take care of Jaguars and you will not be disappointed.  Keep the fluids changed regularly, all of them. Mine recently had the coolant, brake, rear end, and oil changed.  When she gets to 45K miles, I will change the tranny oil. Have put well over 225,000 miles on the open road in Jaguars, the only car in my lifetime that was better was my 2011 Maserati 4.7 QP.

This vehicle was bought used by my dad back in 2012 and it worked great for a number of years but after reaching 300,000 miles it has become a less than desirable vehicle. The battery is always causing issues, and it squeaks when you drive it. Also fast food is a no go because the driver's window doesn't roll down and the radio refuses to play music.

       "   'Back in 2010, my father traded his 2009 Hemi Orange R/T challenger in on a brand new 2011 Yellow Blaze Fiesta 5 door hatch with every option on it except for the automatic transmission. Sunroof, leather seats, upgraded sound system, you name it. It was truly one of a kind and to this day I’ve still never seen one like it. I’ve seen a few other yellow blazes but never one with the options ours had. In 2017, he gave it to me as my first car. It had 50,000 miles at the time. I learned how to drive stick on it! The car isn’t the fastest thing in the world, but it sure is a blast to drive. They handle wonderfully. I quickly fell in love with this car and called her the Highlighter. My dad helped me install Rockford fosgate speakers in her, a 12” Rockford fosgate punch p3 subwoofer and a kicker 800w amp. She bumped! I loved her even more after this. I had countless first dates in her until I met the woman I thought I was going to marry and was with her for two short years before that fell apart. I drove her hard, very hard. My foot was on the floor practically everywhere I went, sliding her around any and every corner. She took it all. I did this for 80,000 more miles. She reached 130,000 miles and needed a timing belt change, so we decided we would do that ourselves. Mind you, this car never needed work, it never failed to start on me, never threw codes, always got me where I needed to go safe and sound and I never worried about it not starting. So doing this timing belt change was honestly some of the first work we had to do to this car other than brakes, oil changes, and a serpentine belt at 80,000 miles. In the process of us locking the flywheel, the special tool to do so broke and made its way inside the transmission somewhere. We couldn’t get it out; but we were able to get her back together running just fine once again. However, while under the car trying to get that part out, we noticed something. On the manual transmission fiestas, there tends to be a problem with a transmission oil leak when your clutch starts to go out. This was a stock clutch with 130,000 miles on it, driven by me, a teenager at the time. There’s no way it should’ve made it as long as it did with the abuse it took, but it did. It’s almost $3,000 to have a new clutch installed in one of these cars, which essentially totals the car out. I had to make the decision to either keep the fiesta and dump its value into it to fix it when it was already up there in miles, or trade it in on an ecoboost mustang. I decided to trade her because ford wouldn’t be able to fix her for a couple of months and I was moving for college so I needed a car. I stand by my word, that fiesta will forever be the most reliable car I will have ever owned. It took so much more than any other car should’ve or would’ve. Truly one of the best cars in the world in my eyes. The mpg is just a plus on top of the reliability of these things. I’ll forever miss my fiesta, I had such a sentimental attachment to this car that I don’t think anyone will ever understand. But I hope the right person is reading this and if you’re debating getting one, get it. You wont regret it. I miss mine more and more everyday. That ecoboost mustang is cool and all, but it’ll never be my fiesta. My fiesta made so many memories with me from whether it was being the clown car trying to cram all my friends into her even though her carry capacity is 800lbs, or from those first dates previously mentioned. She was known around town because I was involved in the car scene and took her everywhere. I was proud of my fiesta. You would be too. I really hope I see mine out there on day again. If you happen to have a debadged 2011 yellow blaze 5-speed manual fiesta hatch with 127,000+ miles, you may have my baby and I hope she treats you well.',\n",

The Sport Trac has done everything I needed it to do with ease that it's hard to remember how life was without it. I've used it during hurricane season to bring large heavy lumber home to cover up the windows and doors, it has towed lawn mowing equipment, towed paint equipment and with only 2wd it has taken me offroad when I've needed it too. Thus far I'm getting 16mpg on average which is awesome considering I do have a heavy foot and it has heavy A/T tires. What I truly appreciate the Sport Trac for is how comfortable it is to live with, its absolutely quiet and smooth on any surface thanks to the IRS, the Mustang GT derived V8 is very quiet, silky smooth and well behaved and only let's its presence known when you get on it and you hear it roar. \\n\\nOnly issues ive had with my Sport Trac was the radiator had a small leak and the fan clutch got stuck while driving so they needed to be replaced but luckily both times the truck didn't over heat and didnt leave me stranded.\\n\\nSpark plugs on these 3v 4.6 engines are a real hassle so make sure to prepare yourself before replacing them. Broken exhaust manifold studs are a common issue that is somewhat difficult to fix but luckily it's harmless if left broken, mine have been broken for over a year now and the only issue I have is ticking at cold start that goes away after 30sec. Oil changes must be done every 5,000 miles, the cam phasers on the 3v 4.6 are very sensitive to changes in oil pressure, dirty oil and varnish so using synthetic oil and changing it every 5k miles insures a clean engine and long service life, also only use the Motorcraft oil filter since they are made for oil pressure sensitive engines like the 4.6 3V.\\n\\nOverall I highly recommend this vehicle to anybody looking for a small truck to daily around, it literally can do everything you need it too just remembered to service it and it will treat you great.\",\n",

I'm just grateful to Gustman Honda in Appleton and my salesman Jon Devet for being so great and helping me keep to my budget while still getting SO much car! I know she's 6yrs old but shes like new to me, and I love her. Great car!\",\n",

It was decently comfortable but the seats were fairly firm and on long trips I would get a little sore (Alberta Canada to Southern California). It is very slow, not completely unbearably slow, but it is very slow. On the bright side, it gets great gas mileage for an AWD compact suv. Another thing to note is over the 50,000km we didn't have to take it in for any sort of mechanical issues at all. Just oil changes and standard maintanence. Obviously I don't know how it would do down the line, but judging by the few issues it gave us I'm sure it would be a very reliable vehicle in the long term.\",\n",

The Sport Trac has done everything I needed it to do with ease that it's hard to remember how life was without it. I've used it during hurricane season to bring large heavy lumber home to cover up the windows and doors, it has towed lawn mowing equipment, towed paint equipment and with only 2wd it has taken me offroad when I've needed it too. Thus far I'm getting 16mpg on average which is awesome considering I do have a heavy foot and it has heavy A/T tires. What I truly appreciate the Sport Trac for is how comfortable it is to live with, its absolutely quiet and smooth on any surface thanks to the IRS, the Mustang GT derived V8 is very quiet, silky smooth and well behaved and only let's its presence known when you get on it and you hear it roar. \\n\\nOnly issues ive had with my Sport Trac was the radiator had a small leak and the fan clutch got stuck while driving so they needed to be replaced but luckily both times the truck didn't over heat and didnt leave me stranded.\\n\\nSpark plugs on these 3v 4.6 engines are a real hassle so make sure to prepare yourself before replacing them. Broken exhaust manifold studs are a common issue that is somewhat difficult to fix but luckily it's harmless if left broken, mine have been broken for over a year now and the only issue I have is ticking at cold start that goes away after 30sec. Oil changes must be done every 5,000 miles, the cam phasers on the 3v 4.6 are very sensitive to changes in oil pressure, dirty oil and varnish so using synthetic oil and changing it every 5k miles insures a clean engine and long service life, also only use the Motorcraft oil filter since they are made for oil pressure sensitive engines like the 4.6 3V.\\n\\nOverall I highly recommend this vehicle to anybody looking for a small truck to daily around, it literally can do everything you need it too just remembered to service it and it will treat you great.\",\n",

       "   \"I've owned this car for 4 years now. It is my 1st Cadillac and I just love it! The ATS is reliable no matter what the weather. It's quick and powerful yet, great on gas mileage. It has all the features you could ever want: 2 wheel, or all wheel driving, heated seats, heated steering wheel, sunroof, programable garage door button, sync cell phone for hands free, push button start, remote start, can even start car from Google/Alexa. Has standard Apps on touchscreen for NAV, Weather, OnStar and Pandora (music). Love the sound quality from the Boise speakers. Despite all the features that I love; There are a couple of design flaws of the car: ATS has a sporty design, it is low rider. For sure it's a smooth ride, however it being so low you do feel all the bumps in the road and slowing down for railroad tracks is a must. I'm only 5'2 and have to step down to get into it. Anyone close to 6 foot tall will bump their knee or head getting into it. As for cabin room, it is tight quarters. This vehicle is not for the driver who likes to carry a lot of things in (their) car. The trunk is small and very little storage inside the cabin area. The front seat has standard small glove box, a small hidden compartment but still too small to really store & access everyday items like sunglasses, coins/change or cell phone. The biggest and most costly Con about the car is getting the headlamp(s) changed. You can't do it yourself, it's too tight of an area to get your hand in the light housing area. It's designed to where you have to take it to a mechanic and they will have to literally remove the front bumper to get access and getting this done is costly expense. Luckily the headlights don't burn out often, but it is a added expense to have in mind. Over all, it is the best vehicle I've owned and I have a wonderful experience driving my ATS and I will drive it until it can't go anymore, then I'll most likely get another!\",\n",

       "   \"I bought the 2015 cx5 used a few months ago with 88k miles on it. Based on my research it should last up to 300k miles with regular maintenance and non aggressive driving. I have the grand touring trim in all black. It's a very good looking vehicle inside and out. Placement of gauges is very good and buttons/functions are easy to access. Temperature functions are simple and work really well. Good venting. Windshield wipers work fine but the intermittent timer sometimes seems to fluctuate either based on speed of the car or there's something malfunctioning. I can't tell to be honest. Storage is good and there's enough pockets, compartments and spaces for personal items.  Overall the look and feel seems right on the bubble of being luxury. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe handling is on the stiffer side made to give a feel of performance which it does. I get a pretty strong connection with the road. The turns are tight. It feels good to drive and it's even fun though I don't push that. I used to have a Mazda protege in the 90's and it gave that handling excitement despite its modest power. The cx5 reminds me why I liked that car. The lag when pressing hard on the gas is a bit annoying and the 0-60 time seems a bit slow for the 184hp 2.5l engine but once it gets into it's power band it goes. Gas mileage is very good imo. I get 26 mpg combined city/highway. \\r\\n\\r\\nSeats are comfortable enough though I might have chosen the touring model for the cloth seats instead of leather because items slide off the seats and I notice some wear and stitching tears that I'll need to have repaired. The adjustments with the seats are very good I think. I like the lumbar support. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe hatchback works well but I would have appreciated an automatic open/close function. I haven't had a large hatchback before and it's a bit annoying having to force the closing if I have items in my hand. 1st world criticism certainly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest issue with this model year (and I think all models up to 2018(?) is the gps and entertainment unit. It uses the old TomTom navigation system which is very clunky and too frustrating to bother with. I use my phone instead. The entertainment system works well enough but I'm surprised it included a CD player even in 2015. I don't listen to the radio or have a Sirius subscription so I mostly Bluetooth connect my phone for streaming music and navigation. It shouldn't be necessary with an integrated system already in place but the installed system is that bad. It's all made worse by the Bluetooth tech. It often disconnects for no reason and sometimes takes a minute or longer for the system to recognize my phone. Sometimes it will be connected but there's no sound, again for no reason I can see. Usually these issues happen at start up and once I'm driving a few minutes it works fine. If I watch a video on phone there's a big latency lag from the phone to the stereo. It's big enough that it's unwatchable since a mouth moves but the sounds come later. I have to disconnect bluetooth when watching a video which is a major annoyance. I'm planning on replacing the stereo head unit in the future which hopefully will solve all these problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall it's really a great car.\",\n",

The car turns on a dime so it's easy to park and very responsive.   The few things we wish this car had are a higher center console to rest our elbow on during longer drives, non-leather seats because they feel harder/stiffer than the cloth and things slide off the seats easily; and a cargo cover.

Put\\'s mustangs and some chargers/challengers to shame. Has a lot of grip, but steering is numb and very light. Has a bit of rev hang. Leather seats are very comfortable, but the suspension is a bit bumpy at times (its not a german luxury car so its not a big deal). Shifter feels a wee bit numb, but cause it has rubber bushings. Manual transmission has very aggressive gearing, 1st doesn\\'t need any throttle at all to get going and can at time start in 2nd, 80mph @ 3000rpm in 6th. E-Brake handle feels super cheap, but it is a honda so o big deal. Doors are nice and long, giving great visibility. Back end looks super sexy. V6 sounds like pure sex, especially at 4900rpm and up (VTEC range), redlines about 7000rpm, has lots of torque so you can pass in 6th on the highway very easily. MPG is listed at 18/28 but you can realistically get a bit more than 30 on the highway if you use cruise control or don\\'t drive too fast (65-75). Back seats fit up to 3 average sized adults for trips not too long, great rearseat room for a coupe. Auto-dimming rearview mirror is a blessing, and blindspot camera (if yours has it) is very useful. Trunk is pretty spacious, with back seats down it can easily fit skis or snowboards and other long but not too wide cargo cause it has a chokepoint between the trunk and the seats which limits width. Handling is great, but you don\\'t get any feedback from the steering wheel and steering is super light (electric pwsteering). Body doesn\\'t roll too much in corners. in my opinion, VERY UNDERBRAKED. Brakes are not nearly big enough for the power this car has. Good for normal use but driving at a track or in Mexico at 100mph+ the brakes fade extremely quickly and lose stopping power, then begin to warp a bit (goes a way after a while but sucks in the moment) I had a couple \"Oh xxxx\" moments underestimating the brakes due to them being hot. User beware. Get some LED headlights if it doesn\\'t come with any, the halogen bulbs are pretty weak. FCW (front collision warning) is very annoying and too sensitive at the lowest setting so turn that off. ECO mode is absolutely a must, it does NOT limit power it just makes the already sensitive throttle more linear and natural feeling, saving vital MPG during normal driving. Pedals are kind of small so harder to heel-toe in normal or more narrow shoes. You will have to replace tires often cause burnouts are so easy and fun even possible up to 3rd (joking obviously). \\r\\n\\r\\nIF skeptical, BUY ONE! just make sure it was taken care of, but you will have tons of fun while still being able to daily it every day for a trillion miles cause the Honda J35 runs for centuries (the ones without cylinder deactivation). DONT LET FWD DEALBREAK YOU! it still drives and handles amazingly. \\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion: amazing daily for enthusiasts looking for a good combo of fun, comfort, reliability.',\n",

       "   'Dealers who sell pre-owned or off-lease are selling these in MN.  There may be one near you, too.  It\\'s definitely worth checking, as the range is a make-or-break for many people.    This car is affordable because of its range. Sure, the estimate will display up to 124 miles (could be more) when fully charged, but as you start driving, you\\'ll see that first percent only gets you about half a real-life mile, and so it continues.  I can absolutely count on 50 real-life miles per charge normally.  Not normally: range can drop to 40 miles if the ambient temperature is below 10-degrees Fahrenheit, or above 95 degrees (F).  Both the motor and the battery have to regulate their operating temp, and it sucks electricity to run those systems.  Same with cabin temp.  Too, some public chargers won\\'t charge this car below 10 degrees (F).  The displayed mileage I now call my \"efficiency score.\"  I\\'ve gotten it as high as 124, but generally sit around 110... because I don\\'t use freeways.  Faster speeds draw more juice, but given you\\'re covering greater distance, it doesn\\'t make as big a difference as lots of deep (slow downs and) accelerations.  It\\'s a learning curve, to be sure.  I dropped a star from \"comfort\" because the back seats are super cramped, and the trunk is 11\" deep with the seats up (though it\\'s pretty normal as a two-seater).  Had they angled the back wall more vertically, it would have created a lot more usable space.  One last complaint: as with every post-2010 car I\\'ve seen, there isn\\'t enough glass to actually see the road.  I\\'m wobbling around in my seat trying to see around the supports, but I can\\'t find anything different that isn\\'t virtually vintage.  Glass isn\\'t cheap, lightweight, nor particularly safe... *during* a crash.\\n\\nHere\\'s why I love it: as a mom (I have three people\\'s worth of driving to do, plus some return trips), I\\'m saving over US$200/mo paying for electricity instead of gas.  Yes, you can plug it right into a regular outlet for a slow charge.  That\\'s enough for getting around a decently-sized metro area, \\'burbs included.  I used my savings this summer to rent and ICE and take a road trip.  It\\'s dangerously responsive; the steering and acceleration are so tight it took me months to adjust.  Way, way fun.  People love that I\\'m tackling electric, and the magic of a car loan on this car makes it doable for anyone over 18 years old with a middling credit record.  It\\'s a good bleeding edge place to be.  \\n\\nOne caveat: second owners don\\'t get all the digital features, like location tracking and the account that goes with it, Tom-tom/GPS-system updates, remote starting (which never worked for most people, anyway).  Forget connecting or hacking... legally.  It\\'s still a great car, and you need internet on your phone to charge at public chargers, but the car won\\'t connect to anything for anything except by Bluetooth, and even then only to make phone calls.  You\\'ll want a Bluetooth dongle to connect for media consumption.']},\n",

Second, the DEF system throws error codes at least once a month stating it will make the vehicle inoperable in 200 miles unless serviced.  Third, the repeated recall after recall relating to several exhaust issues.  Fourth, the Summit version, which I bought, has leather on the dash so poorly glued that the whole thing has started delaminating.

Sixth, the fuel filters, there are 2, require replacing every 15k miles at a cost of around $170 each.  Seventh, the wheel arch covers have come unglued and Jeep refuses to fix that either saying it's a wear item and body issue that an independent body shop must fix.

       "   'Bought the 2013 back in 2019 as I had a Santa Fe prior to this one and liked it for the most part. Once I hit about 90k miles I had an issue with the engine. Apparently it was a recall and the dealership fixed it for free (needed a software update). I want to add though that Hyundai doesn\\'t offer courtesy vehicles and told me I had to pay out of pocket for a rental while they had my car for \"possibly 3 or 4 weeks until we can look at it...\" \\r\\nIt drove fine after that. About 7-8 months later I noticed it was taking a bit more to accelerate and was loud anytime I accelerated getting up a hill or onto the highway. Then at 103k miles the engine failed on me. I took it to a private mechanic first who told me the code he scanned came back as being yet another recall and I had to go back to the dealership. On my way to the dealership the car started clanking very loudly and then lost all power while I was driving. Luckily I was on a backroad not driving fast so I was able to just come to a stop on a side street. \\r\\nIt was sluggish, unable to accelerate going uphill or faster than 40-45mph, clanking, and the engine light was flashing.

But they, VW, proved it can come back from adversity and provide the consumer with a car they can trust.

Never did like the computer mpg estimates. Not bad for a fully laden vehicle with three passengers and all the luggage. In town it is a blast to drive with the 6 speed manual transmission. When it needs to it can get up and go. Not super car performance by any means, but will provide the average driver with a rush of adrenaline and performance when needed. Good enough for having just spent a purchase price < $10k. This thing has over 100,000 mile and still running strong.

The only solution, per Ford, is to replace the engine.

Otherwise, I really like this car. It didn't act up when I bought it used, but then the telltale signs of this engine flaw started: the Check Engine light came on (fault codes P0302, P0304, and P0300 all indicate engine cylinder misfires, which are a symptom of the coolant leak) when the engine started running rough periodically, then more often. Both a local independent repair shop and the Ford dealer confirmed the problem and 'solution'. The car isn't worth the cost of the repair and Ford has not fully acknowledged the problem.

Transmission is shifting a little bit rough, starting at about 105,000 miles.  Transmission fluid was changed by dealership at about 30K and again by dealership at about 80K... so well taken care of, but I have this gut feeling that the transmission will have problems before 150K.

The range isn't great, the flimsy tires need getting used to - but for what a used (ideally certified pre-owned) one goes for - I really don't think you can go wrong. Unless you live in a city and have good places to charge - it probably is not a suitable car as your only car - but it's a great addition if you don't depend on it for a 300 mile drive. Accelerations is fun, the car is a lot bigger inside than it looks. It has a little bit of a theme park ride feel to it at times.\",\n",

       "   \"Overall, this car is meeting our needs. My wife likes to drive it, and the acceleration is amazing. The range is very limited, so even a short trip to a nearby city requires a stop at a recharge station. (10-12 minutes)\\nMain complaint is that it get very very hot in the sun. The windshield radiates heat down onto the passengers, and the roof also gets very hot. This makes the car uncomfortable in summer.\\nI am not impressed with the reliability. The electrical system in our vehicle has been quirky...sometimes the windows move by themselves. The AC light would not turn on, even if the AC was obviously running. (Dealer replaced it but it took some wrestling.) I still can't figure out how to set a few favorite stations on the radio buttons. \\nFinally, and very annoyingly, the car quit working without warning recently while I was out on a short errand. Due to COVID I have not been driving it much, and apparently it can't keep it's 12V auxiliary battery fully charged in this case. This then quickly led to complete failure of the 12V battery and the car disabled itself. No warning. And apparently I am not alone, because the dealer told me there is a 3 week wait for a replacement battery!\\nTo me the engineering that went into this car is below BMW standards.\",\n",
