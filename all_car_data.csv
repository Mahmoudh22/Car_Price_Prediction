Hits way above its price tag. The seats are very comfortable, plenty of room for taller people in back and front. Gas mileage is great and the Bose radio is very enjoyable to listen too.  Almost everything inside feels good to the touch and is premium. Is it perfect? No. The road noise is loud. Almost too loud. I knew that going into it but didn’t think it would be an issue but its annoying (and this is coming from a 2003 camry). The ride is firm and sporty so don’t expect a lounge chair, the upside to that is excellent handling. Storage inside is minimal and beside the road noise is my only big complaint.  But at least the trunk is generous and their is room where it counts. This car gets looks everywhere I go and is fun to drive. No it’s not fast but it is adequate.  So in summary the three biggest highlights are looks, mpg and premium feel. If those are not high priorities look elsewhere.  It was a good deal and fits my needs for now. Would I buy again? Probably not. The latest generation camry isn’t far off the marks in the looks department and I can only speculate offers more supple ride and far less road noise. But used ones still cost more then the mazda 6 I bought as well. Im hoping the mazda is as reliable as it is nice to look at and that will help.']",5.0

Almost everything inside feels good to the touch and is premium. Is it perfect? No. The road noise is loud. Almost too loud. I knew that going into it but didn’t think it would be an issue but its annoying (and this is coming from a 2003 camry). The ride is firm and sporty so don’t expect a lounge chair, the upside to that is excellent handling. Storage inside is minimal and beside the road noise is my only big complaint.  But at least the trunk is generous and their is room where it counts. This car gets looks everywhere I go and is fun to drive. No it’s not fast but it is adequate.  So in summary the three biggest highlights are looks, mpg and premium feel. If those are not high priorities look elsewhere.  It was a good deal and fits my needs for now. Would I buy again? Probably not. The latest generation camry isn’t far off the marks in the looks department and I can only speculate offers more supple ride and far less road noise. But used ones still cost more then the mazda 6 I bought as well. Im hoping the mazda is as reliable as it is nice to look at and that will help.']",5.0

Why? It’s goodness has a few flies in the ointment: here are some quirks to this good car that frustrate and bother. \r\nHandling is great, but I question the run-flat tire design decision. Run-flats are harsh and noisy, but the suspension is tuned to compensate (except for the noise).  There are no jack points or jack, so we are kinda stuck with the expense and noise. \r\nThe 2.0 liter dual-scroll turbo is really fun. The light-weight body allows the engine to move the car quickly and nimbly. The engine does have draw-backs. Blow-by can carbon up the valves, and since the engine is direct injection, the valves are not cleaned by the atomized intake gas. Carefully scheduled oil changes are crucial for engine longevity. \r\nAnd then there is the CUE system. The knob-less infotainment system is better than you would expect (one gets used to it in surprising ways), but the touch-screen overlay dies. It has a gel layer between two screens that dries out and renders the touch screen useless. The part to repair it is cheap, but the center console must be completely disassembled to get to the screen. Very very poor engineering because cars sit in the sun and the the gel will delaminate. (Replacement screens without the gel layer are available.) Folks are frustrated: you didn’t hear it from me, but there is a class action suit regarding this screen and Cadillac’s blindness to addressing it’s flaws. \r\nI’m 6-0 and hit my head on the door edge every time I get in and out. You’d expect that of a goofy Italian car, but not of a Cadillac. Big deal?  No, just reality. \r\nSo, with no spare it has a huge trunk, right?  Nope. The entire space under the trunk floor from axle to bumper is filled with a huge…..muffler. This is just plain bizarre. Biggest muffler/resonator I’ve ever seen. Exhaust note is underwhelming. \r\nWith these little niggling bothers, the car remains one of my favorite sports sedans. It hustles but with composure and control. It is comfy on long drives, but instantly awakens for a mountain drive or twisty. The sales record indicates my frustrations are common. But drive it.
