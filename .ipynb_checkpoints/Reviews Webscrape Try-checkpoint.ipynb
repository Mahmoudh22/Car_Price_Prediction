Still not as ridiculous as a coupe door design. \\nCargo space is so tiny with backseats up. \\nCarseats for infants are difficult to place without sacrificing significant space for either the driver or the front passenger. \\n\\nMy final verdict. \\nIf you purchase a 24amp or a more capable charger than you can manage. \\nIf you're soccer mom, or switch your hats often, this base model may not be for you. Still, if you really really a planner it may work out beautifully.\\nIf you're purchasing this as second car for the family, then you can save tons in cost. \\nIf you spot a free ev charging station you can literally run your range to close to empty then leave it at the charging station and picked it up after couple of hours.\",\n",

I have a 2014 ST1 with 237,000 miles on the clock  the car is an overall fun experience it is not NC Miata fun but it's 75% of the way and you can still do daily driver things like have trunk space. It is a little more performance-oriented than something like a golf GTi  if you enjoy a nice interior cabin more then a little more hoon factor then I would go with the Golf.  I have Pirelli p zeros all around and the car is not the best in rain or snow to be expected it's front-wheel drive the nanny State traction control makes it worse. When you get this car in it's ideal state a B-road it does well the torque vectoring really helps and it's a blast at speed's that won't have you taking a trip to jail.  If you are driving like a normal civilized person on the highway it also does fairly well it will do your average highway speed no problem in 6th Gear at a low RPM getting  somewhere in the range of 26.5 to 34 miles to the gallon depending on where you are (my record is 35.2mpg downhill 55mpg 6th gear.).  While it can accelerate and has power on the highway this is not a rocket ship it has enough power to be competent but it is not fast cabin space is not terrible there is a little bit of noise but that's really not bad considering it's an Econo box with a turbo.  As for maintenance it hasn't really been any issues a couple plastic hoses here and there because high mileage  these cars like a lot of front wheel drive cars tend to eat motor mounts as well as front brakes but both are to be expected with a front wheel drive car I would also recommend a catch-can.

Best thing of all it is not that attractive which means less gold diggers and  criminals (thieves) are less interested in stealing it.

       "   'I purchased it used 6 months ago with very high mileage. I am still in shock of how good this vehicle is. For starters, not having to do specifically or exclusively with Expeditions, this vehicle is very clean in an out and all around. The paint still shines like new and I believe it to be original, 9/10. The interior shows very light ware. Some leather conditioner and she’ll be a 10/10.  The reality is that vehicles like these are usually purchased by very large families with kids so the interiors are usually bad news. Having said that, the previous owner of this vehicle REALLY LOVED this truck as I do. 200k miles on the clock and this thing rides like a dream. I have all the same features and options as the unit used for this article, with the addition of video player with dual monitors on the headrests. The gas mileage is not great but I work from home and we have a multi vehicle household so the gas mileage was not as much a concern for me as it may be for others. In all honesty, I spend my time driving it around on weekends trying to find things to do or cargo to fill it up with just because I can. I am not a handy guy so projects around the house are handled by payed handymen, but I am literally always trying to think about what I can put in it. I am considering purchasing a small travel trailer for some camping adventures. The one thing I am tempted to do, but won’t, is to take a very long road trip in it. I won’t because it does have the previously mentioned 200k on the odometer and because I am not handy, I don’t want to have something go wrong 1k miles from home, but it is so tempting. This is truly one of, if not THE BEST vehicle I’ve ever owned. If you want to look trendy or like to attract attention with a flashy car, this is not the one for you. It looks very dated. My last piece of advice, DO NOT BE OVER CONFIDENT WITH YOUR DRIVING ABILITIES. If you are intimidated by driving a VERY LARGE vehicle in tight spaces or don’t like to use your mirrors to back up because, “I got this,” with your backup camera, this vehicle is not for you. You should be skilled behind the wheel to own this vehicle. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would most certainly recommend this vehicle to anyone in the market for this type of vehicle.',\n",

       "   \"I've dreamed of owning a 911 Turbo since I was in my teens. I'm now 63 years old and don't need to drive 150mph anymore. Last year my wife and I decided to look for a convertible to recapture the days of when we first started dating in 1987 when she had a 1982 Fiat Spyder 2000 convertible. We traded that in 2004 on a BMW 330Xi. We had a pretty sweet deal lined up on a 2008 BMW Z4 until the day before we went to pick it up and found out the dealer sold it from under us. What could have really sucked turned into a golden opportunity: we chanced upon a 2001 Boxster S with 59,000 original miles. We have not regretted the decision one bit. Yes, the ergonomics are somewhat dated compared to today and it's not the latest and greatest technology, but we bought it to drive, not to be distracted with all sorts of gizmos. (I'm employed as a Sales representative at a local Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep Dealer for over 35 years. I'm exposed to all the technology). This little Bavarian bomber is an absolute blast to drive; comfortable, quick, sticks to the road like burnt eggs to a cast iron frying pan, and turns heads everywhere. It's capable of 160+ mph, but the right road at 55 mph brings grins all the time. We just went for a weekend trip with it and had no problem with room for our luggage, a tote bag, and a small soft-sided cooler. And as an added bonus, we took it through the famed Hawk's Nest Highway on Route 97 north of Port Jervis, NY.  Wonderful to drive, comfortable even after a couple hours, fuel-efficient (except when I play with the Tiptronic on a twisty road), and so far, dead-bolt reliable. So I didn't get my 911 Turbo; the Boxster S is a more than welcome consolation prize. You owe it to yourself. \\r\\nP.S- My wife drives it more than I do!\",\n",

Now I'm having trouble with oil consumption on this car. Been topping the oil from my local oil change center a quart every week. I was told that's the engine will not last if this oil consumption will not be fixed. Been to hyundai ohare, il they did a thorough check and tried to con us for the amount due for a work done- transmission fluids. The replaced the recalls. No mention about fluid leaking from the engine. They don't have a loaner car there so I waited before going through the 1st stage in oil consumption test. Since we got con there, we opted to go to another hyundai dealer in glenview- napleton hyundai. There we went through 2 stages of the oil consumption test, had oil change before the start of the oil consumption test as directed. No oil leak mentioned from there. We didn't finish the 3rd stage coz now the guy in service we dealt with is not working there anymore as we were told. All of a sudden their manager told us that there's oil leak now he noted from the engine. Nothings been mentioned all these time, even from mechanics from the said dealership. So I pulled out our car from there . So I'm left with this unreliable car and I'm afraid of my safety driving in the highway everyday to work as a first responder and to do of my kids to school as well. I've checked my Vin # unfortunately its not one of the list for engine recall but I'm having this problem that need to be addressed. We're so frustrated and angry about this problem without any solution. My previous car I had it for 18 years- Toyota Camry and don't have this problem.

       "   'I purchased it used 6 months ago with very high mileage. I am still in shock of how good this vehicle is. For starters, not having to do specifically or exclusively with Expeditions, this vehicle is very clean in an out and all around. The paint still shines like new and I believe it to be original, 9/10. The interior shows very light ware. Some leather conditioner and she’ll be a 10/10.  The reality is that vehicles like these are usually purchased by very large families with kids so the interiors are usually bad news. Having said that, the previous owner of this vehicle REALLY LOVED this truck as I do. 200k miles on the clock and this thing rides like a dream. I have all the same features and options as the unit used for this article, with the addition of video player with dual monitors on the headrests. The gas mileage is not great but I work from home and we have a multi vehicle household so the gas mileage was not as much a concern for me as it may be for others. In all honesty, I spend my time driving it around on weekends trying to find things to do or cargo to fill it up with just because I can. I am not a handy guy so projects around the house are handled by payed handymen, but I am literally always trying to think about what I can put in it. I am considering purchasing a small travel trailer for some camping adventures. The one thing I am tempted to do, but won’t, is to take a very long road trip in it. I won’t because it does have the previously mentioned 200k on the odometer and because I am not handy, I don’t want to have something go wrong 1k miles from home, but it is so tempting. This is truly one of, if not THE BEST vehicle I’ve ever owned. If you want to look trendy or like to attract attention with a flashy car, this is not the one for you. It looks very dated. My last piece of advice, DO NOT BE OVER CONFIDENT WITH YOUR DRIVING ABILITIES. If you are intimidated by driving a VERY LARGE vehicle in tight spaces or don’t like to use your mirrors to back up because, “I got this,” with your backup camera, this vehicle is not for you. You should be skilled behind the wheel to own this vehicle. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would most certainly recommend this vehicle to anyone in the market for this type of vehicle.',\n",

Bmw either thinks people will bleed 50k (originally) for a substitute car, or people will always have 12-16 hours time to move between errands.\\nDoors design is unusual.

Still, if you really really a planner it may work out beautifully.\\nIf you're purchasing this as second car for the family, then you can save tons in cost. \\nIf you spot a free ev charging station you can literally run your range to close to empty then leave it at the charging station and picked it up after couple of hours.\",\n",
